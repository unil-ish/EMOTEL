  "content": "She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings\nof pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one\nof her age and situation. Nor was she the passionate young lady, who\nperforms so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.\nPassion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped\nbetween love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the\npictorial style. And she was tragical only in the sense that she was\ngreat, for she loved to play on the side of Victory. Victory of what\nand over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.\nBut that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can\ngainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and\nLucy had decided that they should triumph.A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she\nreally liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano. A few\npeople lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she\nmade no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to\nsleep. She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of\nMiss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for\nher cigarette-case. Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by\nthe mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by\ntouch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical\nelement in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge\nWells when he had discovered it. It was at one of those entertainments\nwhere the upper classes entertain the lower. The seats were filled with\na respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish,\nunder the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the\ndrawing of a champagne cork. Among the promised items was “Miss\nHoneychurch. Piano. Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it\nwould be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his\ncomposure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III. He was in\nsuspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens\ndoes one know what the performer intends. With the roar of the opening\ntheme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords\nthat herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory. He\nwas glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have\npaid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of\nnine-sixteen. The audience clapped, no less respectful. It was Mr.\nBeebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards."

Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal\nthat it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if\nanything, disturbs.”“Introduce me.”“She will be delighted. She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises\nof your sermon.”“My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe. “Why ever did she listen to it?”When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch,\ndisjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity\nof dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face. She loved going\nto concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee\nand meringues. He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also. But\nbefore he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he\nnow made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved\ndreamily towards him:“If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very\nexciting both for us and for her.”Lucy at once re-entered daily life.“Oh, what a funny thing! Some one said just the same to mother, and she\nsaid she trusted I should never live a duet.”“Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?”“She doesn’t mind it. But she doesn’t like one to get excited over\nanything; she thinks I am silly about it. She thinks—I can’t make out.\nOnce, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any\none’s. She has never got over it. Of course, I didn’t mean that I\nplayed well; I only meant—”“Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality. She could not\ncomplete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet. The whole\nlife of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in\nEurope had turned into formless lumps of clothes.The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,\nand the hills were dirty purple. Somewhere in their folds were\nconcealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon\nto visit the Torre del Gallo.“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply."

  "content": "The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold,\ntired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and\na tickling cough in her throat. On another day, when the whole world\nwas singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse\nto stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no\nfit companion for a hearty girl.“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray. She hopes to find the true\nItaly in the wet I believe.”“Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy. This was a stock remark,\nthe supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of\ndefinition. Miss Lavish was so original. Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but\nthey would have been put down to clerical narrowness. For that, and for\nother reasons, he held his peace.“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is\nwriting a book?”“They do say so.”“What is it about?”“It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.\nLet me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words\nherself more admirably than any one I know.”“I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself. We started such friends. But\nI don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in\nSanta Croce. Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically\nalone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.”“The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.”He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently\ndissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish. They were always in each\nother’s company, with Lucy a slighted third. Miss Lavish he believed he\nunderstood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of\nstrangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. Was Italy deflecting her\nfrom the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at\nTunbridge Wells? All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they\nwere his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample\nopportunities for the work. Girls like Lucy were charming to look at,\nbut Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his\nattitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather\nthan enthralled."

But in the south-west there had appeared a dull\nhaze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean\nworse. She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the\nroom, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at\nthe same moment by the door.“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill! And Mr. Beebe here\nbesides. Who would suppose this is Italy? There is my sister actually\nnursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.”She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was\non entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in\nmy room with the door shut. Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one\nhas the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches\nit from another.”Lucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of\nhis adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his\nbath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented\nhimself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan. The Italians\nare a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything,\nand they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their\nmercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the\ncab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.\nYet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial! They have no\nconception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini,\nwho exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I\nsuffer over the children’s edjucaishion. _Hi_ won’t ’ave my little\nVictorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’”Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an\nagreeable way. Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe,\nhaving expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and\nwho wore a pair of russet whiskers. Indeed, who would have supposed\nthat tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that\nmilitant form?"

  "content": "In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last\nthe cause was disclosed. From the chair beneath her she extracted a\ngun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the\ninitials “E. L.”“That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman. “A good fellow, Lavish,\nbut I wish she’d start a pipe.”“Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.\n“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as\ndreadful as you suppose. She took to it, practically in despair, after\nher life’s work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it\nmore excusable.”“What was that?” asked Lucy.Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It\nwas a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice\nnovel. It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I\nmust say they nearly always do. Anyhow, she left it almost finished in\nthe Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she\nwent for a little ink. She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But\nyou know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to\nthe beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember\nwhat she has written. The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got\ntempted into cigarettes. It is a great secret, but I am glad to say\nthat she is writing another novel. She told Teresa and Miss Pole the\nother day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be\nabout modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not\nstart till she had an idea. First she tried Perugia for an inspiration,\nthen she came here—this must on no account get round. And so cheerful\nthrough it all! I cannot help thinking that there is something to\nadmire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.”Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better\njudgement. A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving\nthem unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there\nsometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring. She felt she had made\nalmost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her\ntoleration."

That old Mr.\nEmerson, who puts things very strangely—”Her jaw dropped. She was silent. Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were\nendless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a\nhasty whisper:"

As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. But\nthe point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his\nmentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different\ngrades of thought. She thought they were commercial\ntravellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she\ntried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on\nnothing but commerce. Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table\nbefore the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one\nwho can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful\npicture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut! The early\nVictorians.’ Just imagine! ‘Tut! The early Victorians.’ My sister had\ngone, and I felt bound to speak. I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early\nVictorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure\nagainst our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking. I reminded her how\nthe Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must\nsay she was dumbfounded, and made no reply. But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson\noverheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!\nI honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman! I tell things so\nbadly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on\naccount of S. having been mentioned in the first place. But that was\nnot all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss\nAlan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.\nCome, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation,\nand she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas,\nand said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who\nwas in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial\ntravellers.”“Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I\nshall go alone.’ She went. At the end of five minutes she returned\nunobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.”“Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.“No one knows. No one will ever know. Miss Lavish will never dare to\ntell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.”“Mr. Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice? I do so want to\nknow.”Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for\nherself.“No; but it is so difficult. Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do\nnot mind him. Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he nice?”The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. Mr.\nBeebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:“I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after\nthat business of the violets.”“Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get\nround? A pension is a bad place for gossips. No, I cannot forget how\nthey behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce. Oh, poor Miss\nHoneychurch! It really was too bad. No, I have quite changed. I do\n_not_ like the Emersons. They are _not_ nice.”"

  "content": "Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly. He had made a gentle effort to introduce\nthe Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed. He was\nalmost the only person who remained friendly to them. Miss Lavish, who\nrepresented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans,\nwho stood for good breeding, were following her. Miss Bartlett,\nsmarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. The case of Lucy\nwas different. She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in\nSanta Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and\npossibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from\ntheir own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows\nand joys. This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be\nchampioned by a young girl: he would rather it should fail. After all,\nhe knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are\nflimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the\nEmersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now. Even their\nseats at dinner had been moved.“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said\nthe little lady inquisitively.“Only once. Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite\npolitely, of course.”“Most right of her. They don’t understand our ways. They must find\ntheir level.”Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under. They had given up their\nattempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost\nas silent as the son. He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant\nday for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy\nwell chaperoned to be nice to them. It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief\npleasures to provide people with happy memories.Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the\ncolours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its\nmuddy solidity and began to twinkle. There were a few streaks of\nbluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the\nearth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in\nthe declining sun.“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief. “All the\ngalleries are shut.”“I think I shall go out,” said Lucy. “I want to go round the town in\nthe circular tram—on the platform by the driver.”Her two companions looked grave. Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for\nher in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say:“I wish we could. Unluckily I have letters. If you do want to go out\nalone, won’t you be better on your feet?”“Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!”But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe\nas to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the\nstreet frequented by tourists."

I put it down to too much\nBeethoven.”Chapter IV\nFourth ChapterMr. Beebe was right. Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after\nmusic. She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the\nsuggestive twitterings of Miss Alan. Conversation was tedious; she\nwanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her\non the wind-swept platform of an electric tram. This she might not\nattempt. It was unladylike. Why? Why were most big things unladylike?\nCharlotte had once explained to her why. It was not that ladies were\ninferior to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to\ninspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.\nIndirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could\naccomplish much. But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be\nfirst censured, then despised, and finally ignored. Poems had been\nwritten to illustrate this point.There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady. The dragons have\ngone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst. She\nreigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early\nVictorian song. It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of\nbusiness, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.\nBut alas! the creature grows degenerate. In her heart also there are\nspringing up strange desires. She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and\nvast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea. She has marked the\nkingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a\nradiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the\nreceding heavens. Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move\njoyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with\nother men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are\nalive. Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august\ntitle of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self."

Here and there a restriction annoyed her\nparticularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that\nshe had done so. This afternoon she was peculiarly restive. She would\nreally like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved. As\nshe might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus,\nbeing a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss\nBartlett had persuaded her to do without it. (A pity in art of course\nsignified the nude.) Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the\nSistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it. She felt a\nlittle calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s\n“Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni\nMadonnas. For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical\napproval to every well-known name.But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed\nstill unopened. She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her\nto be conscious of it. “The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of\nbeautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not\nsurprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that\nit always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza\nSignoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to\nher. The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to\nstrike it. Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,\nhalf ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who\nidled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance\nof a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth\nupon the arrivals and departures of mankind. It was the hour of\nunreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real. An older\nperson at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient\nwas happening to him, and rest content. Lucy desired more."

It seemed no\nlonger a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable\ntreasure throbbing in the tranquil sky. Its brightness mesmerized her,\nstill dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and\nstarted towards home.Then something did happen.Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt. “Cinque\nlire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and\none of them was hit lightly upon the chest. He frowned; he bent towards\nLucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for\nher. He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out\nbetween them and trickled down his unshaven chin.That was all. A crowd rose out of the dusk. It hid this extraordinary\nman from her, and bore him away to the fountain. Mr. George Emerson\nhappened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where\nthe man had been. How very odd! Across something. Even as she caught\nsight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her,\nfell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.She thought: “Oh, what have I done?”“Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything. She had\ncomplained of dullness, and lo! one man was stabbed, and another held\nher in his arms.They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade. He must have\ncarried her. He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees. She\nrepeated:“Oh, what have I done?”“You fainted.”“I—I am very sorry.”“How are you now?”“Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.“Then let us come home. There’s no point in our stopping.”He held out his hand to pull her up. She pretended not to see it. The\ncries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily. The whole\nworld seemed pale and void of its original meaning.“How very kind you have been! I might have hurt myself falling. But now\nI am well. I can go alone, thank you.”His hand was still extended.“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.“What photographs?”“I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.

You’d go openly if you were.”“But I had rather—”“Then I don’t fetch your photographs.”“I had rather be alone.”He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit\ndown till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him. “And\ndon’t move till I come back.”In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in\ndreams. The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day,\nand joined itself to earth. How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he\nreturned from the shadowy square? Again the thought occurred to her,\n“Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man,\nhad crossed some spiritual boundary.He returned, and she talked of the murder. Oddly enough, it was an easy\ntopic. She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous\nover the incident that had made her faint five minutes before. Being\nstrong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood. She rose\nwithout his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her,\nshe walked firmly enough towards the Arno.

I’m glad I’ve told you; and all\nthe time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with\nthem.” He pointed down-stream. “They’ve gone.” The river swirled under\nthe bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed\nbetter that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean\nthat they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man. “For\nsomething tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting\nmuddled. It isn’t exactly that a man has died.”Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.”“Mr. Emerson—”He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some\nabstract quest.“I want to ask you something before we go in.”They were close to their pension. She stopped and leant her elbows\nagainst the parapet of the embankment. He did likewise. There is at\ntimes a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that\nhave suggested to us eternal comradeship. She moved her elbows before\nsaying:“I have behaved ridiculously.”He was following his own thoughts.“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what\ncame over me.”“I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude\nrepelled him.“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.”“Oh, all right.”“And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are\ngossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?”“I’m afraid I don’t.”“I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?”“Your behaviour? Oh, yes, all right—all right.”“Thank you so much. And would you—”"

He had thrown her\nphotographs into it, and then he had told her the reason. It struck her\nthat it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man. He would do\nher no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even\nkind; he might even have a high opinion of her. But he lacked chivalry;\nhis thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe. It was\nuseless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete\nthe sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the\nknight in that beautiful picture. She had been in his arms, and he\nremembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that\nshe had bought in Alinari’s shop. It was not exactly that a man had\ndied; something had happened to the living: they had come to a\nsituation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the\nbranching paths of Youth.“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents\ndo happen, and then one returns to the old life!”“I don’t.”Anxiety moved her to question him.His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.”“But why, Mr. Emerson? What do you mean?”“I shall want to live, I say.”Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno,\nwhose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.Chapter V\nPossibilities of a Pleasant OutingIt was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte\nBartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over\nLucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and\npaid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson. She and\nMiss Lavish had had an adventure also. They had been stopped at the\nDazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent\nand _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. It\nmight have been most unpleasant. Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match\nfor any one.For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone. None of\nher friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the\nembankment. Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at\ndinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much\nBeethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,\nnot that she had encountered it. This solitude oppressed her; she was\naccustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,\ncontradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking\nright or wrong."

Mr. Beebe was walking up to the\nTorre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies. Would Miss\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party? Charlotte declined for\nherself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. But she\nthought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing\nmoney, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss\nBartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish\nalone.“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth. “It’s very kind of\nMr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.”“Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure\nthat called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy. How\nabominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always! But now she should\nalter. All morning she would be really nice to her.She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the\nLung’ Arno. The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and\ncolour. Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at\nit. She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and\nyour mother could see this, too!”Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly\nwhere she did.“Look, Lucia! Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party. I\nfeared you would repent you of your choice.”Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent. Yesterday had been\na muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down\neasily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping\nwere preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del\nGallo. Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not\nto re-enter it. She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s\ninsinuations.But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately\nremained. Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the\nriver to the Piazza Signoria. She could not have believed that stones,\na Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For\na moment she understood the nature of ghosts.The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss\nLavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand. She hailed them\nbriskly. The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an\nidea which she thought would work up into a book."

Now, you are to\ntell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy\npoked at the ground with her parasol.“But perhaps you would rather not?”“I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.”The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable\nthat a girl should feel deeply.“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless\ncreatures. I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we\nwouldn’t pry.”She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few\ncalculations in realism. Then she said that she had been in the Piazza\nsince eight o’clock collecting material. A good deal of it was\nunsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. The two men had\nquarrelled over a five-franc note. For the five-franc note she should\nsubstitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and\nat the same time furnish an excellent plot.“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.“I do hope she’s nice.”That desideratum would not be omitted.“And what is the plot?”Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. But it all came while\nthe fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish\nconcluded. “It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people. Of\ncourse, this is the barest outline. There will be a deal of local\ncolouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall\nalso introduce some humorous characters. And let me give you all fair\nwarning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.”“Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett. “I am sure you are\nthinking of the Emersons.”Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile."

For I repeat and I insist, and I have always\nheld most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less\ntragic because it happened in humble life.”There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded. Then the\ncousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across\nthe square.“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett. “That\nlast remark struck me as so particularly true. It should be a most\npathetic novel.”Lucy assented. At present her great aim was not to get put into it. Her\nperceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that\nMiss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,”\ncontinued Miss Bartlett slowly. “None but the superficial would be\nshocked at her. We had a long talk yesterday. She believes in justice\nand truth and human interest. She told me also that she has a high\nopinion of the destiny of woman—Mr. Eager! Why, how nice! What a\npleasant surprise!”“Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching\nyou and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.”“We were chatting to Miss Lavish.”His brow contracted.“So I saw. Were you indeed? Andate via! sono occupato!” The last remark\nwas made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with\na courteous smile. “I am about to venture a suggestion. Would you and\nMiss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a\ndrive in the hills? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.\nThere is a point on that road where we could get down and have an\nhour’s ramble on the hillside. The view thence of Florence is most\nbeautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole. It is the view\nthat Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.\nThat man had a decided feeling for landscape. Decidedly. But who looks\nat it to-day? Ah, the world is too much for us.”"

He was a member of the\nresidential colony who had made Florence their home. He knew the people\nwho never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta\nafter lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,\nand saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.\nLiving in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in\nRenaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and\nexchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather\nperception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their\npockets the coupons of Cook.Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.\nBetween the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and\nit was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who\nseemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the\npermanent. Tea at a Renaissance villa? Nothing had been said about it\nyet. But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same. But the joys of life\nwere grouping themselves anew. A drive in the hills with Mr. Eager and\nMiss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no\nlonger the greatest of them. She echoed the raptures of Charlotte\nsomewhat faintly. Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming\ndid her thanks become more sincere.“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain. “In these days\nof toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message\nof purity. Andate via! andate presto, presto! Ah, the town! Beautiful\nas it is, it is the town.”They assented.“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of\ntragedies. To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there\nis something portentous in such desecration—portentous and\nhumiliating.”“Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett. “Miss Honeychurch happened to\nbe passing through as it happened. She can hardly bear to speak of it.”\nShe glanced at Lucy proudly.“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question. “Do not\nblame her, please, Mr. Eager. The fault is mine: I left her\nunchaperoned.”“So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested\nsympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing\ndetails would not be unacceptable. His dark, handsome face drooped\nmournfully towards her to catch her reply.“Practically.”"

I trust that\nneither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?”Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable\nwas this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble\nafter blood. George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.“And you and your friend—”“Were over at the Loggia.”“That must have saved you much. You have not, of course, seen the\ndisgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public\nnuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes\non worrying me to buy his vulgar views.”Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal\nleague of Italy with youth. He had suddenly extended his book before\nMiss Bartlett and Mr. Eager, binding their hands together by a long\nglossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of\nFra Angelico’s angels. She tore. A shrill cry rose from the vendor. The\nbook it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.“Ignore him,” said Mr. Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away\nfrom the square.But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a\ngrievance. His mysterious persecution of Mr. Eager became relentless;\nthe air rang with his threats and lamentations. He appealed to Lucy;\nwould not she intercede?

Under the chaplain’s guidance\nthey selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little\npicture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little\nframes, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out\nof oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap\nmosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from\nreal; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and\nPsyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost\nless in London.This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy. She had\nbeen a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr. Eager, she\nknew not why. And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough,\nceased to respect them. She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great\nartist. She doubted that Mr. Eager was as full of spirituality and\nculture as she had been led to suppose. They were tried by some new\ntest, and they were found wanting. As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte\nshe was exactly the same. It might be possible to be nice to her; it\nwas impossible to love her.“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact. A mechanic of\nsome sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the\nSocialistic Press. I came across him at Brixton.”They were talking about the Emersons.“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett,\nfingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.“Generally,” replied Mr. Eager, “one has only sympathy for their\nsuccess. The desire for education and for social advance—in these\nthings there is something not wholly vile. There are some working men\nwhom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as\nthey would make of it.”“Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.”He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a\nsigh.“Oh, so he has a wife.”“Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead. I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the\neffrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with\nme. He was in my London parish long ago. The other day in Santa Croce,\nwhen he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him. Let him beware that\nhe does not get more than a snub.”“What?” cried Lucy, flushing.“Exposure!” hissed Mr. Eager."

We know that\nalready.”“Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s\npenetration.“I should be astonished if you knew all. The boy—an innocent child at\nthe time—I will exclude. God knows what his education and his inherited\nqualities may have made him.”“Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not\nhear.”“To speak plainly,” said Mr. Eager, “it is. I will say no more.” For\nthe first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the\nfirst time in her life.“You have said very little.”“It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.\nShe turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved\nquickly. He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips. It\nwas intolerable that she should disbelieve him.“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily. “That man murdered his\nwife!”“How?” she retorted.“To all intents and purposes he murdered her. That day in Santa\nCroce—did they say anything against me?”“Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.”“Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is\nonly their personal charms that makes you defend them.”“I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing\ninto the old chaotic methods. “They’re nothing to me.”“How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much\ndiscomfited by the unpleasant scene. The shopman was possibly\nlistening.“She will find it difficult. For that man has murdered his wife in the\nsight of God.”The addition of God was striking. But the chaplain was really trying to\nqualify a rash remark. A silence followed which might have been\nimpressive, but was merely awkward.

Why should he invite us in that absurd manner? We might as well\ninvite him. We are each paying for ourselves.”Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was\nlaunched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.\nEager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I\nforesee a sad kettle of fish.”“How?”“Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.”“That will mean another carriage.”“Far worse.
