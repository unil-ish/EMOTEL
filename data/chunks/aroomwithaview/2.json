Oh, is our drive to come off?”Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the\ncomplacency of Mr. Eager was restored.“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed. “It\nis just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at\nall. Why should he invite us in that absurd manner? We might as well\ninvite him. We are each paying for ourselves.”Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was\nlaunched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.\nEager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I\nforesee a sad kettle of fish.”“How?”“Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.”“That will mean another carriage.”“Far worse. Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor. She knows it herself. The\ntruth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.”They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank. Lucy stood by\nthe central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer,\nor at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain. The\nwell-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic\ncity where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.\nMurder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being\nrude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets? Was\nthere more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to\nevoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a\nfulfillment?"

  "content": "Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not\nmatter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with\nadmirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost\nsight of the goal as she approached it. Now she was crouching in the\ncorner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag\nwhich hung in chaste concealment round her neck. She had been told that\nthis was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be\nbroached within the walls of the English bank. As she groped she\nmurmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager, or Mr.\nEager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave\nEleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we\nmust be prepared. It is you they really want; I am only asked for\nappearances. You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor\nwill follow behind. A one-horse carriage would do for us. Yet how\ndifficult it is!”“It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded\nsympathetic.“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the\nstruggle, and buttoning up her dress.“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.”“Oh, dear, Lucy! I do hope Florence isn’t boring you. Speak the word,\nand, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.”“Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of\nathletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her\nmother’s letters could be. She had read in it of the crocuses which had\nbeen bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new\nparlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of\nthe semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and\nbreaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway. She recalled the free, pleasant\nlife of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where\nnothing ever happened to her. The road up through the pine-woods, the\nclean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her\nbright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to\nwhich, after much experience, a traveller returns.“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.“Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news\nthat interested her least. “Do you know the Vyses?”“Oh, not that way back. We can never have too much of the dear Piazza\nSignoria.”“They’re nice people, the Vyses. So clever—my idea of what’s really\nclever. Don’t you long to be in Rome?”“I die for it!”"

  "content": "The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant. It has no grass, no\nflowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting\npatches of ruddy brick. By an odd chance—unless we believe in a\npresiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity\nsuggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment\nof youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity. Perseus and\nJudith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something,\nand though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after\nexperience, not before. Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might\na hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly. “Here’s an idea. What if we\npopped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel? For I do\nknow what I want. I’m sick of Florence. No, you said you’d go to the\nends of the earth! Do! Do!”Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:“Oh, you droll person! Pray, what would become of your drive in the\nhills?”They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing\nover the unpractical suggestion.Chapter VI\nThe Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson,\nMr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and\nMiss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians\nDrive Them.It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth\nall irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up\nthe stony hill. Mr. Beebe recognized him at once. Neither the Ages of\nFaith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany\ndriving a cab. And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on\nthe way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender\nand pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still\nshading her eyes from the unaccustomed light. To her Mr. Eager\nobjected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must\nguard against imposition. But the ladies interceded, and when it had\nbeen made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was\nallowed to mount beside the god."

  "content": "Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling\nhimself to drive with his arm round her waist. She did not mind. Mr.\nEager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the\nindecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy. The\nother two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss\nLavish. For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without\nconsulting Mr. Eager, had doubled the size of the party. And though\nMiss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the\npeople were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came\nround they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while\nMiss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus\ntransformed. Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,\nwas now impossible. Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about\nthem, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. But a\nshoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the\nsight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these\nexplosive ingredients, attentive to Mr. Eager, repressive towards Miss\nLavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep,\nthanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring. She looked\non the expedition as the work of Fate. But for it she would have\navoided George Emerson successfully. In an open manner he had shown\nthat he wished to continue their intimacy. She had refused, not because\nshe disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and\nsuspected that he did know. And this frightened her.For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia,\nbut by the river. To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.\nBut to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and\nthrough silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled\nemotion, but of the whole fabric. There was really something\nblameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy\nstream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house\nwithout the passing of a look or word. This sense of wickedness had\nbeen slight at first. She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del\nGallo. But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative\nthat she should avoid him again. And now celestial irony, working\nthrough her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave\nFlorence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.Meanwhile Mr. Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was\nover."

  "content": "“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling? As a student of art?”“Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!”“Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like\nmyself?”“Oh, no. I am here as a tourist.”“Oh, indeed,” said Mr. Eager. “Are you indeed? If you will not think me\nrude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed\nabout like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to\nRome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious\nof anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’\nor ‘through’ and go on somewhere else. The result is, they mix up\ntowns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl. You know the American\ngirl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the\nfather replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller\ndog.’ There’s travelling for you. Ha! ha! ha!”“I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to\ninterrupt his mordant wit. “The narrowness and superficiality of the\nAnglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.”“Quite so. Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it\nis of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are\nhere for trade, for example. But the greater part are students. Lady\nHelen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico. I mention her\nname because we are passing her villa on the left. No, you can only see\nit if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall. She is very proud of\nthat thick hedge. Inside, perfect seclusion. One might have gone back\nsix hundred years. Some critics believe that her garden was the scene\nof The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?”“It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish. “Tell me, where do they place the\nscene of that wonderful seventh day?”"

  "content": "But Mr. Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right\nlived Mr. Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and\nthat the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill. “Doubtless you know\nher monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’? He is working at\nGemistus Pletho. Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I\nhear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with\nits loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’\nFiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and\nI think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.”During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each\nother disgracefully. Lucy had a spasm of envy. Granted that they wished\nto misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. They were\nprobably the only people enjoying the expedition. The carriage swept\nwith agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the\nSettignano road.“Piano! piano!” said Mr. Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his\nhead.“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped\nhis horses up again.Now Mr. Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the\nsubject of Alessio Baldovinetti. Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or\nwas he one of its manifestations? The other carriage was left behind.\nAs the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr.\nEmerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a\nmachine.“Piano! piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat. Phaethon, who for\nsome time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was\nmost unpleasant. The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to\ndisentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl\nwas immediately to get down.“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.Mr. Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but\nat its manner. At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping\nhad awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated,\nand patted them on the back to signify his approval. And Miss Lavish,\nthough unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of\nBohemianism.“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried. “But I dare say I\nshall receive scant support. I have always flown in the face of the\nconventions all my life. This is what _I_ call an adventure.”"

  "content": "“We must not submit,” said Mr. Eager. “I knew he was trying it on. He\nis treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.”“Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called\nout that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave\nthemselves properly.“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood\nin no awe. “Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off\nthe box when it happens to sit there? To be driven by lovers—A king\nmight envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than\nanything I know.”Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun\nto collect.Mr. Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a\nresolute will, was determined to make himself heard. He addressed the\ndriver again. Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream,\nwith unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony. In\nMr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling\nfountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker,\nand more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a\nclick.“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased. Why\nshould he appeal to Lucy?“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto. She pointed\nat the other carriage. Why?For a moment the two girls looked at each other. Then Persephone got\ndown from the box.“Victory at last!” said Mr. Eager, smiting his hands together as the\ncarriages started again.“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson. “It is defeat. You have parted\ntwo people who were happy.”Mr. Eager shut his eyes. He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but\nhe would not speak to him. The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took\nup the matter warmly. He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted\nfor support to his son.“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. He has\nbargained to drive us, and he is doing it. We have no rights over his\nsoul.”"

  "content": "Miss Lavish frowned. It is hard when a person you have classed as\ntypically British speaks out of his character.“He was not driving us well,” she said. “He jolted us.”“That I deny. It was as restful as sleeping. Aha! he is jolting us now.\nCan you wonder? He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is\njustified. And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl,\ntoo. It doesn’t do to injure young people. Have you ever heard of\nLorenzo de Medici?”Miss Lavish bristled.“Most certainly I have. Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to\nLorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of\nhis diminutive stature?”“The Lord knows. Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the\npoet. He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t\ngo fighting against the Spring.’”Mr. Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured. “‘War not with the May’ would\nrender a correct meaning.”“The point is, we have warred with it. Look.” He pointed to the Val\nd’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.\n“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them. Do you\nsuppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in\nman? But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as\nimproper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.”"

  "content": "No one encouraged him to talk. Presently Mr. Eager gave a signal for\nthe carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the\nhill. A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and\nmisty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the\nroad, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory\nwhich stood out in the plain. It was this promontory, uncultivated,\nwet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the\nfancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before. He had\nascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an\neye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending. Standing there, he\nhad seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he\nafterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work. But where\nexactly had he stood? That was the question which Mr. Eager hoped to\nsolve now. And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything\nproblematical, had become equally enthusiastic.But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in\nyour head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.\nAnd the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to\nkeep together being only equalled by their desire to go different\ndirections. Finally they split into groups. Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett\nand Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with\nthe drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics\nin common, were left to each other.The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. In the audible whisper\nthat was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio\nBaldovinetti, but the drive. Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson\nwhat his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was\nvery sorry that she had asked him. She had no idea that it would be\nsuch a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. Mr. Beebe had\nturned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man\nwas not very much hurt at her asking him.“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish. “Oh, but I shall die! Of course it\nwas the railway!” She could not control her mirth. “He is the image of\na porter—on, on the South-Eastern.”“Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion. “Hush!\nThey’ll hear—the Emersons—”“I can’t stop. Let me go my wicked way. A porter—”“Eleanor!”“I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy. “The Emersons won’t hear, and\nthey wouldn’t mind if they did.”Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly. “Pouf! Wouf! You\nnaughty girl! Go away!”“Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr. Eager, I’m sure.”“I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.”“Mr. Eager will be offended. It is your party.”“Please, I’d rather stop here with you.”"

  "content": "“No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish. “It’s like a school feast; the boys\nhave got separated from the girls. Miss Lucy, you are to go. We wish to\nconverse on high topics unsuited for your ear.”The girl was stubborn. As her time at Florence drew to its close she\nwas only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent. Such a one\nwas Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte. She wished she\nhad not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her\nremark and seemed determined to get rid of her.“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett. “Oh, I do wish Freddy and\nyour mother could be here.”Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of\nenthusiasm. Lucy did not look at the view either. She would not enjoy\nanything till she was safe at Rome.“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish. “Observe my foresight.”With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that\nprotect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.\nShe sat on one; who was to sit on the other?“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy. The ground will do for me.\nReally I have not had rheumatism for years. If I do feel it coming on I\nshall stand. Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet\nin your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked\nparticularly moist. “Here we are, all settled delightfully. Even if my\ndress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown. Sit down, dear;\nyou are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared\nher throat. “Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold. It’s the tiniest\ncough, and I have had it three days. It’s nothing to do with sitting\nhere at all.”There was only one way of treating the situation. At the end of five\nminutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, vanquished\nby the mackintosh square.She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the\ncarriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. The miscreant, a bony\nyoung man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the\ncourtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought."

He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them\ntowards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.More seemed necessary. What was the Italian for “clergyman”?“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.Good? Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings! He showed her his\ncigar.“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been\ngiven to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?”She was correct as usual. He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to\nmake it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded\nhis hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of\na minute was ready to conduct her. Italians are born knowing the way.\nIt would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but\nas a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces\nas well as the squares. Any one can find places, but the finding of\npeople is a gift from God.He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets. She thanked\nhim with real pleasure. In the company of this common man the world was\nbeautiful and direct. For the first time she felt the influence of\nSpring. His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other\nthings, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?”“Ma buoni uomini.”He bowed. Certainly. Good men first, violets afterwards. They proceeded\nbriskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker. They\nwere nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing\nround them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into\ncountless pieces. He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the\npliant boughs. She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness. Not a\nstep, not a twig, was unimportant to her.“What is that?”"

The view was\nforming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other\nhills.“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of\nthe wood. Light and beauty enveloped her. She had fallen on to a little\nopen terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.\n“Courage and love.”She did not answer. From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view,\nand violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating\nthe hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into\npools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam. But\nnever again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the\nwell-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the\nearth.Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.\nBut he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.George had turned at the sound of her arrival. For a moment he\ncontemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He saw radiant\njoy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue\nwaves. The bushes above them closed.

Mr. Eager had met them with a questioning eye.\nCharlotte had repulsed him with much small talk. Mr. Emerson, seeking\nhis son, was told whereabouts to find him. Mr. Beebe, who wore the\nheated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the\nreturn home. There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. Pan\nhad been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these\ntwo thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social\ncontretemps and unsuccessful picnics. Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and\nhad consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a\npleasant surprise. Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett. Lucy had lost\nMr. Eager. Mr. Emerson had lost George. Miss Bartlett had lost a\nmackintosh square. Phaethon had lost the game.That last fact was undeniable. He climbed on to the box shivering, with\nhis collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. “Let us\ngo immediately,” he told them. “The signorino will walk.”“All the way? He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.“Apparently. I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the\nface; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him. He alone had\nplayed skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had\nused scraps of their intelligence. He alone had divined what things\nwere, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the\nmessage that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a\ndying man. Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could\ninterpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly,\nand perhaps too late.The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of\nhis employers. He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents,\nbut infinitely the least dangerous. Once back in the town, he and his\ninsight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more. Of\ncourse, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the\nbushes; he might make a tavern story out of it. But after all, what\nhave we to do with taverns? Real menace belongs to the drawing-room. It\nwas of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed\ndownwards towards the fading sun. Lucy sat beside her; Mr. Eager sat\nopposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious. They\nspoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.Rain and darkness came on together. The two ladies huddled together\nunder an inadequate parasol. There was a lightning flash, and Miss\nLavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front. At the\nnext flash, Lucy screamed also. Mr. Eager addressed her professionally:"

Are we\nseriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical\ndisplay, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?”“No—of course—”“Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being\nstruck are enormous. The steel knives, the only articles which might\nattract the current, are in the other carriage. And, in any case, we\nare infinitely safer than if we were walking. Courage—courage and\nfaith.”Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand. At\ntimes our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not\nwhat exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it\nafterwards. Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,\ngained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross\nexamination.She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.“Mr. Eager!” called Mr. Beebe. “We want your assistance. Will you\ninterpret for us?”“George!” cried Mr. Emerson. “Ask your driver which way George went.\nThe boy may lose his way. He may be killed.”“Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver\nis no help. Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.”“He may be killed!” cried the old man. “He may be killed!”“Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage. “In\nthe presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.”“What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.\n“Charlotte, how much does Mr. Eager know?”“Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing. But—” she pointed at the\ndriver—“_he_ knows everything. Dearest, had we better? Shall I?” She\ntook out her purse. “It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class\npeople. He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book,\nshe said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it. As well this ending to his day\nas any. But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him."

If they\nhad not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt. They chose to regard\nit as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity,\nwhich fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult. They\ndescended from the carriages; they embraced each other. It was as\njoyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them. For a\nmoment they realized vast possibilities of good.The older people recovered quickly. In the very height of their emotion\nthey knew it to be unmanly or unladylike. Miss Lavish calculated that,\neven if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the\naccident. Mr. Eager mumbled a temperate prayer. But the drivers,\nthrough miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the\ndryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me. Kiss me again. Only you can\nunderstand me. You warned me to be careful. And I—I thought I was\ndeveloping.”“Do not cry, dearest. Take your time.”“I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse. Once\nby the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?”The thought disturbed her repentance. As a matter of fact, the storm\nwas worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she\nthought it must be near to everyone.“I trust not. One would always pray against that.”“He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.\nBut this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that. I simply\nslipped into those violets. No, I want to be really truthful. I am a\nlittle to blame. I had silly thoughts. The sky, you know, was gold, and\nthe ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a\nbook.”“In a book?”“Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.”“And then?”“But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.”Miss Bartlett was silent. Indeed, she had little more to learn. With a\ncertain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to\nher. All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which\nnothing could repress.“I want to be truthful,” she whispered. “It is so hard to be absolutely\ntruthful.”“Don’t be troubled, dearest. Wait till you are calmer. We will talk it\nover before bed-time in my room.”"

Mr. Beebe had regained good\nhumour, and Mr. Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish. Charlotte alone\nshe was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and\nlove.The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long\nevening. She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she\nshould describe it. All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her\nmoments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be\ncarefully laid before her cousin. And together in divine confidence\nthey would disentangle and interpret them all.“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself. I shan’t again be\ntroubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know\nwhat.”Miss Alan asked her to play. She refused vehemently. Music seemed to\nher the employment of a child. She sat close to her cousin, who, with\ncommendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.\nWhen it was over she capped it by a story of her own. Lucy became\nrather hysterical with the delay. In vain she tried to check, or at all\nevents to accelerate, the tale. It was not till a late hour that Miss\nBartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of\ngentle reproach:“Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire. Come into my\nroom, and I will give a good brush to your hair.”With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the\ngirl. Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?”She was unprepared for the question. It had not occurred to her that\nshe would have to do anything. A detailed exhibition of her emotions\nwas all that she had counted upon.“What is to be done? A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.”The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt\ndamp and chilly. One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers\nclose to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic\nshadows on the bolted door. A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt\nunaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. She lifted\nthem to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless\nand vague, the very ghosts of joy."

But unfortunately I have met\nthe type before. They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.”“Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first? Come here and\nlisten to me. I am only gathering it from his own remarks. Do you\nremember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking\none person is an extra reason for liking another?”“Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.“Well, I am no prude. There is no need to call him a wicked young man,\nbut obviously he is thoroughly unrefined. Let us put it down to his\ndeplorable antecedents and education, if you wish. But we are no\nfarther on with our question. What do you propose to do?”An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner\nand made it part of her, might have proved victorious.“I propose to speak to him,” said she.Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it. But—as you\nsaid—it is my affair. Mine and his.”“And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?”“Certainly not. There would be no difficulty. Whatever you ask him he\nanswers, yes or no; then it is over. I have been frightened of him. But\nnow I am not one little bit.”"

You are so young and inexperienced, you\nhave lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can\nbe—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her\nsex does not protect and rally round. This afternoon, for example, if I\nhad not arrived, what would have happened?”“I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning\nit more vigorously.“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?”“I can’t think,” said Lucy again.“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?”“I hadn’t time to think. You came.”“Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?”“I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off. She\nwent up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.\nShe could not think what she would have done.“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett. “You will be\nseen from the road.”Lucy obeyed. She was in her cousin’s power. She could not modulate out\nthe key of self-abasement in which she had started. Neither of them\nreferred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and\nsettle the matter, whatever it was, with him.Miss Bartlett became plaintive.“Oh, for a real man! We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is\nhopeless. There is Mr. Eager, but you do not trust him. Oh, for your\nbrother! He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse\nin him a very lion. Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead. There are\nstill left some men who can reverence woman.”As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and\nranged them upon the pin cushion. Then she blew into her gloves and\nsaid:“It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.”“What train?”“The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.“When does the train to Rome go?”“At eight.”“Signora Bertolini would be upset.”“We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had\ngiven notice already.“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.”“I expect she will. However, we shall be much more comfortable at the\nVyses’ hotel. Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?”"

To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled\nlike a ghostly figure in a dream.They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to\nlose, if they were to catch the train to Rome. Lucy, when admonished,\nbegan to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the\ndiscomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte,\nwho was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk,\nvainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and\nsize. She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her\nback, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.\nThe girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of\nthose emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.\nShe only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier,\nthe world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.\nThe impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly. She knelt\ndown by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth. But she\nwas not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not\nlove her, but needed her to love. For it was in ominous tones that she\nsaid, after a long pause:“Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?”Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what\nforgiving Miss Bartlett meant. Her emotion relaxed, she modified her\nembrace a little, and she said:“Charlotte dear, what do you mean? As if I have anything to forgive!”“You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself,\ntoo. I know well how much I vex you at every turn.”“But no—”Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged\nmartyr.“Ah, but yes! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had\nhoped. I might have known it would not do. You want someone younger and\nstronger and more in sympathy with you. I am too uninteresting and\nold-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.”“Please—”"

I had my own poor ideas of what a\nlady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than\nwas necessary. You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.”“You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other,\nheart and soul. They continued to pack in silence.“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the\nstraps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own. “Failed to make\nyou happy; failed in my duty to your mother. She has been so generous\nto me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.”“But mother will understand. It is not your fault, this trouble, and it\nisn’t a disaster either.”“It is my fault, it is a disaster. She will never forgive me, and\nrightly. For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss\nLavish?”“Every right.”“When I was here for your sake? If I have vexed you it is equally true\nthat I have neglected you. Your mother will see this as clearly as I\ndo, when you tell her.”Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said:“Why need mother hear of it?”“But you tell her everything?”“I suppose I do generally.”“I dare not break your confidence. There is something sacred in it.\nUnless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.”The girl would not be degraded to this.“Naturally I should have told her. But in case she should blame you in\nany way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to. I will never\nspeak of it either to her or to any one.”Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.

At present she neither acquitted nor\ncondemned him; she did not pass judgement. At the moment when she was\nabout to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since,\nit was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now,\ncould be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss\nBartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor\ninconsistent. She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed,\nfor years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented\nto the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in\nwhich the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a\nshamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but\nwhich do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have\nused them most.Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has\nyet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity,\nof her craving for sympathy and love. Such a wrong is not easily\nforgotten. Never again did she expose herself without due consideration\nand precaution against rebuff. And such a wrong may react disastrously\nupon the soul.The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters. Before she reached\nthem she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle. Thus it was that,\nthough she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked\nup, did not see her.To reach his room he had to go by hers. She was still dressed. It\nstruck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she\nwould be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary\nintercourse was over.Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved. At the\ncritical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said:“I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.”Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr.\nEmerson.”His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done\nher work.Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true. It can’t all be true. I want not to\nbe muddled. I want to grow older quickly.”Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.“Go to bed at once, dear. You need all the rest you can get.”In the morning they left for Rome.PART TWOChapter VIII\nMedievalThe drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for\nthe carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun. They\nwere heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that\nfiltered through them was subdued and varied. A poet—none was\npresent—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,”\nor might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against\nthe intolerable tides of heaven. Without was poured a sea of radiance;\nwithin, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of\nman."
