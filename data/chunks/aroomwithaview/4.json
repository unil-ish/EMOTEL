  "content": "“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “Lucy, don’t desert us—go\non playing bumble-puppy. Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been\nthe oddest place. That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being\nthere. Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop? By-the-by, we really must\nask Charlotte here some time.”Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer. He suggested that his\nhostess was mistaken. At the hint of opposition she warmed. She was\nperfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same\nstory had been told. The name escaped her. What was the name? Oh, what\nwas the name? She clasped her knees for the name. Something in\nThackeray. She struck her matronly forehead.Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.“I must go,” she said gravely. “Don’t be silly. You always overdo it\nwhen you play.”As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil\nair, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it\nright. Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made\nher connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of\nnondescript tourists. Hitherto truth had come to her naturally. She saw\nthat for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely\ntruthful? Well, at all events, she must not tell lies. She hurried up\nthe garden, still flushed with shame. A word from Cecil would soothe\nher, she was sure.“Cecil!”“Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He seemed\nin high spirits. “I was hoping you’d come. I heard you all\nbear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here. I, even I, have won a\ngreat victory for the Comic Muse. George Meredith’s right—the cause of\nComedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have\nfound tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa. Don’t be angry! Don’t\nbe angry! You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.”He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled\nher ridiculous forebodings at once.“I have heard,” she said. “Freddy has told us. Naughty Cecil! I suppose\nI must forgive you. Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!\nCertainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have\nnice friends of yours. But you oughtn’t to tease one so.”"

  "content": "“Friends of mine?” he laughed. “But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!\nCome here.” But she remained standing where she was. “Do you know where\nI met these desirable tenants? In the National Gallery, when I was up\nto see my mother last week.”“What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously. “I don’t quite\nunderstand.”“In the Umbrian Room. Absolute strangers. They were admiring Luca\nSignorelli—of course, quite stupidly. However, we got talking, and they\nrefreshed me not a little. They had been to Italy.”“But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country\ncottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends. I\nthought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their\naddress and a London reference, found they weren’t actual\nblackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—”“Cecil! No, it’s not fair. I’ve probably met them before—”He bore her down.“Perfectly fair. Anything is fair that punishes a snob. That old man\nwill do the neighbourhood a world of good. Sir Harry is too disgusting\nwith his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.\nNo, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with\nme. There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things. I believe in\ndemocracy—”“No, you don’t,” she snapped. “You don’t know what the word means.”He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be\nLeonardesque. “No, you don’t!”Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.“It isn’t fair, Cecil. I blame you—I blame you very much indeed. You\nhad no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look\nridiculous. You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that\nit is all at my expense? I consider it most disloyal of you.”She left him.“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness. As long as Lucy thought that\nhis own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not\nminded. He perceived that these new tenants might be of value\neducationally. He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who\nwas silent. In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would\nbring them to Windy Corner."

  "content": "Chapter XI\nIn Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed FlatThe Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not\ndisdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse. His idea of bringing the Emersons\nto Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through\nthe negotiations without a hitch. Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement,\nmet Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned. The Miss Alans were duly\noffended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held\nresponsible for the failure. Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the\nnew-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as\nsoon as they arrived. Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that\nshe permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his\nhead, to be forgotten, and to die.Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows\nbecause there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but\nsettled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.\nNow that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and\nwere welcome into the neighbourhood. And Cecil was welcome to bring\nwhom he would into the neighbourhood. Therefore Cecil was welcome to\nbring the Emersons into the neighbourhood. But, as I say, this took a\nlittle thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather\ngreater and rather more dreadful than it should have done. She was glad\nthat a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie\nVilla while she was safe in the London flat.“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept\ninto his arms.Cecil, too, became demonstrative. He saw that the needful fire had been\nkindled in Lucy. At last she longed for attention, as a woman should,\nand looked up to him because he was a man.“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do! I don’t know what I should do without you.”"

  "content": "Several days passed. Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett. A\ncoolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not\ncorresponded since they parted in August. The coolness dated from what\nCharlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased\namazingly. For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval\nworld becomes exasperating in the classical. Charlotte, unselfish in\nthe Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in\nthe Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue\ntheir tour. Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs. Vyse was an\nacquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and\nMiss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned\nsuddenly. Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for\nLucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as\nfollows. It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.“TUNBRIDGE WELLS,\n“_September_.“DEAREST LUCIA,“I have news of you at last! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your\nparts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome. Puncturing her\ntire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very\nwoebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a\ndoor open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out. He said his\nfather had just taken the house. He _said_ he did not know that you\nlived in the neighbourhood (?). He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup\nof tea. Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean\nbreast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who\nwill forbid him to enter the house, etc. That was a great misfortune,\nand I dare say you have told them already. Mr. Vyse is so sensitive. I\nremember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome. I am very sorry about\nit all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.“Believe me,\n“Your anxious and loving cousin,\n“CHARLOTTE.”Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows:“BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.“DEAR CHARLOTTE,"

  "content": "“Many thanks for your warning. When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the\nmountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she\nwould blame you for not being always with me. I have kept that promise,\nand cannot possibly tell her now. I have said both to her and Cecil\nthat I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable\npeople—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no\ntea was probably that he had none himself. She should have tried at the\nRectory. I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage. You must see that\nit would be too absurd. If the Emersons heard I had complained of them,\nthey would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they\nare not. I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.\nAs for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for\nmyself. They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the\nother day. We expect to be married in January.“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy\nCorner at all, but here. Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your\nenvelope again. No one opens my letters.“Yours affectionately,\n“L. M. HONEYCHURCH.”Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we\ncannot tell whether our secret is important or not. Were Lucy and her\ncousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if\nhe discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at? Miss\nBartlett suggested the former. Perhaps she was right. It had become a\ngreat thing now. Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and\nher lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.\n“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago. She tried to\ntell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady\nwho had smitten his heart at school. But her body behaved so\nridiculously that she stopped.She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis\nvisiting the scenes they were to know so well later on. It did her no\nharm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society\nitself was absent on the golf-links or the moors. The weather was cool,\nand it did her no harm. In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to\nscrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren\nof famous people. The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness\nthat impressed the girl. One was tired of everything, it seemed. One\nlaunched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself\nup amid sympathetic laughter. In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini\nand Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London\ncareer would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the\npast.The grandchildren asked her to play the piano."

  "content": "She played Schumann. “Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the\nquerulous beauty of the music had died. She shook her head and played\nSchumann again. The melody rose, unprofitably magical. It broke; it was\nresumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave. The\nsadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should\nnever be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of\nthe audience throb. Not thus had she played on the little draped piano\nat the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr.\nBeebe had passed to himself when she returned.When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up\nand down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.\nMrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s,\nhad been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among\nmany people. The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had\nseen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her\nabilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he\nwas not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end\nof each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.\n“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.”“Her music always was wonderful.”“Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent\nHoneychurches, but you know what I mean. She is not always quoting\nservants, or asking one how the pudding is made.”“Italy has done it.”“Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy\nto her. “It is just possible. Cecil, mind you marry her next January.\nShe is one of us already.”“But her music!” he exclaimed. “The style of her! How she kept to\nSchumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven. Schumann was right\nfor this evening. Schumann was the thing. Do you know, mother, I shall\nhave our children educated just like Lucy. Bring them up among honest\ncountry folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and\nthen—not till then—let them come to London. I don’t believe in these\nLondon educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one\nhimself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.”“Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s\nroom. Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought\nit kind to go herself. She found the girl sitting upright with her hand\non her cheek.“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.”“Bad dreams?”"

Dream of that.”Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand. Mrs.\nVyse recessed to bed. Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.\nDarkness enveloped the flat.Chapter XII\nTwelfth ChapterIt was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains,\nand the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.\nAll that was gracious triumphed. As the motorcars passed through Summer\nStreet they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon\ndispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or\nof the pines. Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over\nhis Rectory gate. Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.”“M’m.”“They might amuse you.”Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new\npeople might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just\nmoved in.“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe. “They are worth\nit.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to\nCissie Villa. “Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through\nwhich much squalor was visible.A grave voice replied, “Hullo!”“I’ve brought someone to see you.”“I’ll be down in a minute.”The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed\nto carry up the stairs. Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty. The\nsitting-room itself was blocked with books.“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered. “Are they that\nsort?”“I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment. What have they\ngot? Byron. Exactly. A Shropshire Lad. Never heard of it. The Way of\nAll Flesh. Never heard of it. Gibbon. Hullo! dear George reads German.\nUm—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on. Well, I suppose your\ngeneration knows its own business, Honeychurch.”"

Isn’t it jolly? I like that. I’m certain that’s the old man’s\ndoing.”“How very odd of him!”“Surely you agree?”But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on\nspoiling the furniture.“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.\n“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.”“The same as Lucy’s got.”“Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?”“She came back yesterday.”“I suppose she had a good time?”“Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book. “She and Cecil are thicker\nthan ever.”“That’s good hearing.”“I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.”Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different\nnow, mother thinks. She will read all kinds of books.”“So will you.”“Only medical books. Not books that you can talk about afterwards.\nCecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.\nThere are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed. Cecil\nsays—”“What on earth are those people doing upstairs? Emerson—we think we’ll\ncome another time.”George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.”Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. Perhaps he was\nshy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face\nwanted washing. At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do? Come\nand have a bathe.”“Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.“‘How d’ye do? how d’ye do? Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.\n“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard. But I’m afraid\nit will only act between men. Can you picture a lady who has been\nintroduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How\ndo you do? Come and have a bathe’? And yet you will tell me that the\nsexes are equal.”"

I tell you they\nshall be comrades, and George thinks the same.”“We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you\nplace in the past, is really yet to come. We shall enter it when we no\nlonger despise our bodies.”Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead. We despise the body less\nthan women do. But not until we are comrades shall we enter the\ngarden.”“I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass\nof philosophy that was approaching him.“I believed in a return to Nature once. But how can we return to Nature\nwhen we have never been with her? To-day, I believe that we must\ndiscover Nature. After many conquests we shall attain simplicity. It is\nour heritage.”“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at\nFlorence.”“How do you do? Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George\nfor a bathe. Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.\nMarriage is a duty. I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr.\nVyse, too. He has been most kind. He met us by chance in the National\nGallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house. Though I\nhope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway. I have met so few Liberal\nlandowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game\nlaws with the Conservative attitude. Ah, this wind! You do well to\nbathe. Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!”“Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy. “I must—that is to say, I have to—have the\npleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.”“_Call_, my lad?

Bring them back\nto tea. Bring back some milk, cakes, honey. The change will do you\ngood. George has been working very hard at his office. I can’t believe\nhe’s well.”George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of\none who has handled furniture.“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him. “It is only a pond,\ndon’t you know. I dare say you are used to something better.”“Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.”Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of\nthe house and into the pine-woods. How glorious it was! For a little\ntime the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes\nand philosophy. It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing\nthe bracken and the trees. Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who\ncould not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition\nlooked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a\nword. He spoke of Florence. George attended gravely, assenting or\ndissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as\ninexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse! Did you realize\nthat you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?”“I did not. Miss Lavish told me.”“When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of\nCoincidence.’”No enthusiasm.“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we\nsuppose. For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here\nnow, when one comes to reflect.”To his relief, George began to talk.“It is. I have reflected. It is Fate. Everything is Fate.

There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence\nand Fate. You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our\nfriends. This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.”“It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George. “But you can call it\nItaly if it makes you less unhappy.”Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject. But he\nwas infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is\nstill to write.”Silence.Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that\nyou have come.”Silence.“Here we are!” called Freddy.“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.“In there’s the pond. I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles. There lay the pond,\nset in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain\nthe human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky. On account of the\nrains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like\na beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe. “No\napologies are necessary for the pond.”George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his\nboots.“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid? I love willow-herb in\nseed. What’s the name of this aromatic plant?”No one knew, or seemed to care.“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of\nwater plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or\nbrittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines. Very charming, very charming.”“Mr. Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.Mr. Beebe thought he was not.“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in."

It was necessary to keep clean. Mr. Beebe watched them, and\nwatched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their\nheads.“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes\nin either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded\nmargin.The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed\nthe question properly.“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful,\nwater’s simply ripping.”“Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and\nsputtering at the sun.“Water’s wonderful. Mr. Beebe, do.”“Apooshoo, kouf.”Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible,\nlooked around him. He could detect no parishioners except the\npine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other\nagainst the blue. How glorious it was! The world of motor-cars and\nrural Deans receded inimitably. Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these\nthings not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the\nintrusion of man?“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little\npile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy\nsaid, it reminded one of swimming in a salad. The three gentlemen\nrotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in\nGötterdämmerung. But either because the rains had given a freshness or\nbecause the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of\nthe gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for\nsome reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and\nBotany and Fate. They began to play. Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each\nother. A little deferentially, they splashed George. He was quiet: they\nfeared they had offended him. Then all the forces of youth burst out.\nHe smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked\nthem, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool."

And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the\nsward, proclaiming:“No. We are what matters. Without us shall no enterprise begin. To us\nshall all flesh turn in the end.”“A try!

What miserable management! Why\nnot have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?”“Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and\nif another fellow—”“Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to\nargue. Come, Lucy.” They turned. “Oh, look—don’t look! Oh, poor Mr.\nBeebe! How unfortunate again—”For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface\ngarments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary\nGeorge, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken. “I’ve\nswallowed a pollywog. It wriggleth in my tummy. I shall die—Emerson you\nbeast, you’ve got on my bags.”“Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain\nshocked. “And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first. All these\ncolds come of not drying thoroughly.”“Mother, do come away,” said Lucy. “Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.”“Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.He regarded himself as dressed. Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and\npersonable against the shadowy woods, he called:“Hullo, Miss Honeychurch! Hullo!”“Bow, Lucy; better bow. Whoever is it? I shall bow.”Miss Honeychurch bowed.That evening and all that night the water ran away. On the morrow the\npool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory. It had been a call\nto the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose\ninfluence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for\nyouth.Chapter XIII\nHow Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome"

  "content": "How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview! But she had\nalways rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which\nsurely we have a right to assume. Who could foretell that she and\nGeorge would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of\ncoats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth? She\nhad imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or\nindifferent or furtively impudent. She was prepared for all of these.\nBut she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with\nthe shout of the morning star.Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she\nreflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree\nof accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the\nscenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the\nstage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too\nmuch. “I will bow,” she had thought. “I will not shake hands with him.\nThat will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom? To\ngods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She had bowed across\nthe rubbish that cumbers the world.So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil. It was\nanother of those dreadful engagement calls. Mrs. Butterworth had wanted\nto see him, and he did not want to be seen. He did not want to hear\nabout hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside. He did\nnot want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and\nmade long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done. Lucy\nsoothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised\nwell for their married peace. No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser\nto discover the imperfections before wedlock. Miss Bartlett, indeed,\nthough not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains\nnothing satisfactory. Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded\nthe teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter\nwith Cecil?”The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with\ncharity and restraint.“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.”“Perhaps he’s tired.”Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering\ndispleasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.”“I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.”"

No—it is just the same thing everywhere.”“Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?”“Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?”“Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing\ntrouble ahead. “It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes\nhim sometimes seem—”“Oh, rubbish! If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets\nrid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.“Now, mother! I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!”“Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck. But not in that way.\nNo. It is the same with Cecil all over.”“By-the-by—I never told you. I had a letter from Charlotte while I was\naway in London.”This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs.\nHoneychurch resented it.“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.\nWhenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to\ncontradict me. No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor\nintellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture;\nyour father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly\nremember.”“I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to. But he does\nnot mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset\nhim—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.”“Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?”“You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we\ndo.”“Then why didn’t he leave the room? Why sit wriggling and sneering and\nspoiling everyone’s pleasure?”"

  "content": "“We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy. Something had\nenfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so\nperfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form. The two\ncivilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was\ndazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all\ncivilization had blinded her eyes. Good taste and bad taste were only\ncatchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a\nwhisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from\nthe comic song.She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her\nfrock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made\nthings no better. There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to\nbe supercilious, and he had succeeded. And Lucy—she knew not why—wished\nthat the trouble could have come at any other time.“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.”“All right, mother—”“Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop. Go.”She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window. It faced\nnorth, so there was little view, and no view of the sky. Now, as in the\nwinter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes. One connected the\nlanding window with depression. No definite problem menaced her, but\nshe sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It\nseemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly. And she ought\nnot to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter. She must be more careful;\nher mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was\nabout. Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding\nupstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.“I say, those are topping people.”“My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been! You have no business to take\nthem bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public. It was all right\nfor you but most awkward for everyone else. Do be more careful. You\nforget the place is growing half suburban.”“I say, is anything on to-morrow week?”“Not that I know of.”“Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.”“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this\nmuddle.”“What’s wrong with the court? They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve\nordered new balls.”“I meant _it’s_ better not. I really mean it.”"

Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they\nimpeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans. Then Mrs. Honeychurch\nopened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making! I have\nsomething to say to you. Did you say you had had a letter from\nCharlotte?” and Freddy ran away.“Yes. I really can’t stop. I must dress too.”“How’s Charlotte?”“All right.”“Lucy!”The unfortunate girl returned.“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.\nDid Charlotte mention her boiler?”“Her _what?_”“Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and\nher bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?”“I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly. “I\nshall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.”Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out. She did not. She said: “Come\nhere, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And,\nthough nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and\nWindy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.So the grittiness went out of life. It generally did at Windy Corner.\nAt the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one\nmember or other of the family poured in a drop of oil. Cecil despised\ntheir methods—perhaps rightly. At all events, they were not his own.Dinner was at half-past seven. Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew\nup their heavy chairs and fell to. Fortunately, the men were hungry.\nNothing untoward occurred until the pudding. Then Freddy said:“Lucy, what’s Emerson like?”“I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a\nreply.“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?”“Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.”“He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.Freddy looked at him doubtfully.“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.“Oh, very slightly. I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.”“Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her\nletter.”"

The remark was a happy one,\nfor nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands\nof females. She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those\nwomen who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek\nnotoriety by print. Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let\nthem be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while\nCecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,”\nwith his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s\nwrath. But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to\ngather in the darkness. There were too many ghosts about. The original\nghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it\ncould be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.\nBut it had begotten a spectral family—Mr. Harris, Miss Bartlett’s\nletter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was\nbound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes. It was Miss Bartlett who\nreturned now, and with appalling vividness.“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s. How is\nshe?”“I tore the thing up.”“Didn’t she say how she was? How does she sound? Cheerful?”“Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.”“Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler. I know myself how water\npreys upon one’s mind. I would rather anything else—even a misfortune\nwith the meat.”Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the\nspirit of her remark rather than the substance.“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we\ncould squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday\nwhile the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish. I have not seen poor\nCharlotte for so long.”It was more than her nerves could stand. And she could not protest\nviolently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs."

Freddy’s\ngot a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take\nin Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare. It simply can’t be\ndone.”“Nonsense! It can.”“If Minnie sleeps in the bath. Not otherwise.”“Minnie can sleep with you.”“I won’t have her.”“Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.”“Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again\nlaying his hand over his eyes.“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy. “I don’t want to make difficulties,\nbut it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.”Alas!“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.”“No, I don’t. And no more does Cecil. She gets on our nerves. You\nhaven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be,\nthough so good. So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but\nspoil us by not asking her to come.”“Hear, hear!” said Cecil.Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling\nthan she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of\nyou two. You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of\nbeautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and\nplumbers. You are young, dears, and however clever young people are,\nand however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels\nlike to grow old.”Cecil crumbled his bread.“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on\nmy bike,” put in Freddy. “She thanked me for coming till I felt like\nsuch a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea\njust right.”“I know, dear. She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this\ndifficulty when we try to give her some little return.”But Lucy hardened her heart. It was no good being kind to Miss\nBartlett. She had tried herself too often and too recently. One might\nlay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss\nBartlett nor any one else upon earth. She was reduced to saying: “I\ncan’t help it, mother. I don’t like Charlotte. I admit it’s horrid of\nme.”“From your own account, you told her as much.”“Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly. She flurried—”"

The Sacred Lake would never be the\nsame again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy\nCorner. How would she fight against ghosts? For a moment the visible\nworld faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said\nCecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the\nadmirable cooking.“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because\nin point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I\ndon’t care for eggs. I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.”Cecil frowned again. Oh, these Honeychurches! Eggs, boilers,\nhydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact. “May me and Lucy\nget down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.\n“We don’t want no dessert.”Chapter XIV\nHow Lucy Faced the External Situation BravelyOf course Miss Bartlett accepted. And, equally of course, she felt sure\nthat she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior\nspare room—something with no view, anything. Her love to Lucy. And,\nequally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday\nweek.Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only\nfaced the situation that encompassed her. She never gazed inwards. If\nat times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to\nnerves. When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset\nher nerves. Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might\nupset her nerves. She was nervous at night. When she talked to\nGeorge—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved\nher deeply, and she wished to remain near him. How dreadful if she\nreally wished to remain near him! Of course, the wish was due to\nnerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us. Once she had\nsuffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t\nknow what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet\nafternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be\ndismissed."

  "content": "It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young\nEmerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious. Life is\neasy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves”\nor any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire. She loved\nCecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the\nphrases should have been reversed?But the external situation—she will face that bravely.The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough. Standing between\nMr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy,\nand George had replied. She was anxious to show that she was not shy,\nand was glad that he did not seem shy either.“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his\ncrudities in time. I rather mistrust young men who slip into life\ngracefully.”Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits. He laughs more.”“Yes,” replied the clergyman. “He is waking up.”That was all. But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and\nshe entertained an image that had physical beauty. In spite of the\nclearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival. She\nwas due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs.\nHoneychurch drove to meet her. She arrived at the London and Brighton\nstation, and had to hire a cab up. No one was at home except Freddy and\nhis friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a\nsolid hour. Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with\nlittle Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper\nlawn for tea.“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising\nfrom her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain. “I\nhave upset everything. Bursting in on young people! But I insist on\npaying for my cab up. Grant that, at any rate.”“Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her\nbrother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown\nunsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been\ntrying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.”“I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and\nlooked at her frayed glove.“All right, if you’d really rather. Five shillings, and I gave a bob to\nthe driver.”"
