I\ndon’t think she had caught the name of the bank, and in my nervous\ncowardice I was anxious that she should not; and so I began admiring the\nyellow-spotted lilac gown that I had been utterly condemning only a\nminute before.  But it was of no use.“What bank was it?  I mean, what bank did your note belong to?”“Town and County Bank.”“Let me see it,” said she quietly to the shopman, gently taking it out\nof his hand, as he brought it back to return it to the farmer.Mr Johnson was very sorry, but, from information he had received, the\nnotes issued by that bank were little better than waste paper.“I don’t understand it,” said Miss Matty to me in a low voice.  “That is\nour bank, is it not?—the Town and County Bank?”“Yes,” said I.  “This lilac silk will just match the ribbons in your new\ncap, I believe,” I continued, holding up the folds so as to catch the\nlight, and wishing that the man would make haste and be gone, and yet\nhaving a new wonder, that had only just sprung up, how far it was wise\nor right in me to allow Miss Matty to make this expensive purchase, if\nthe affairs of the bank were really so bad as the refusal of the note\nimplied.But Miss Matty put on the soft dignified manner, peculiar to her, rarely\nused, and yet which became her so well, and laying her hand gently on\nmine, she said—“Never mind the silks for a few minutes, dear.  I don’t understand you,\nsir,” turning now to the shopman, who had been attending to the farmer.\n“Is this a forged note?”“Oh, no, ma’am.  It is a true note of its kind; but you see, ma’am, it\nis a joint-stock bank, and there are reports out that it is likely to\nbreak. Mr Johnson is only doing his duty, ma’am, as I am sure Mr Dobson\nknows.”But Mr Dobson could not respond to the appealing bow by any answering\nsmile.  He was turning the note absently over in his fingers, looking\ngloomily enough at the parcel containing the lately-chosen shawl.“It’s hard upon a poor man,” said he, “as earns every farthing with the\nsweat of his brow.  However, there’s no help for it.  You must take back\nyour shawl, my man; Lizzle must go on with her cloak for a while.  And\nyon figs for the little ones—I promised them to ’em—I’ll take them; but\nthe ’bacco, and the other things”—"

She\nlooked at him with a dubious air.“Perhaps so,” said she.  “But I don’t pretend to understand business; I\nonly know that if it is going to fail, and if honest people are to lose\ntheir money because they have taken our notes—I can’t explain myself,”\nsaid she, suddenly becoming aware that she had got into a long sentence\nwith four people for audience; “only I would rather exchange my gold for\nthe note, if you please,” turning to the farmer, “and then you can take\nyour wife the shawl.  It is only going without my gown a few days\nlonger,” she continued, speaking to me.  “Then, I have no doubt,\neverything will be cleared up.”“But if it is cleared up the wrong way?” said I.“Why, then it will only have been common honesty in me, as a\nshareholder, to have given this good man the money.  I am quite clear\nabout it in my own mind; but, you know, I can never speak quite as\ncomprehensibly as others can, only you must give me your note, Mr\nDobson, if you please, and go on with your purchases with these\nsovereigns.”[Picture: You must give me your note, Mr Dobson, if you please]The man looked at her with silent gratitude—too awkward to put his\nthanks into words; but he hung back for a minute or two, fumbling with\nhis note.“I’m loth to make another one lose instead of me, if it is a loss; but,\nyou see, five pounds is a deal of money to a man with a family; and, as\nyou say, ten to one in a day or two the note will be as good as gold\nagain.”“No hope of that, my friend,” said the shopman.“The more reason why I should take it,” said Miss Matty quietly.  She\npushed her sovereigns towards the man, who slowly laid his note down in\nexchange.  “Thank you.  I will wait a day or two before I purchase any\nof these silks; perhaps you will then have a greater choice.  My dear,\nwill you come upstairs?”"

  "content": "We inspected the fashions with as minute and curious an interest as if\nthe gown to be made after them had been bought.  I could not see that\nthe little event in the shop below had in the least damped Miss Matty’s\ncuriosity as to the make of sleeves or the sit of skirts.  She once or\ntwice exchanged congratulations with me on our private and leisurely\nview of the bonnets and shawls; but I was, all the time, not so sure\nthat our examination was so utterly private, for I caught glimpses of a\nfigure dodging behind the cloaks and mantles; and, by a dexterous move,\nI came face to face with Miss Pole, also in morning costume (the\nprincipal feature of which was her being without teeth, and wearing a\nveil to conceal the deficiency), come on the same errand as ourselves.\nBut she quickly took her departure, because, as she said, she had a bad\nheadache, and did not feel herself up to conversation.As we came down through the shop, the civil Mr Johnson was awaiting us;\nhe had been informed of the exchange of the note for gold, and with much\ngood feeling and real kindness, but with a little want of tact, he\nwished to condole with Miss Matty, and impress upon her the true state\nof the case.  I could only hope that he had heard an exaggerated rumour\nfor he said that her shares were worse than nothing, and that the bank\ncould not pay a shilling in the pound.  I was glad that Miss Matty\nseemed still a little incredulous; but I could not tell how much of this\nwas real or assumed, with that self-control which seemed habitual to\nladies of Miss Matty’s standing in Cranford, who would have thought\ntheir dignity compromised by the slightest expression of surprise,\ndismay, or any similar feeling to an inferior in station, or in a public\nshop.  However, we walked home very silently.  I am ashamed to say, I\nbelieve I was rather vexed and annoyed at Miss Matty’s conduct in taking\nthe note to herself so decidedly.  I had so set my heart upon her having\na new silk gown, which she wanted sadly; in general she was so undecided\nanybody might turn her round; in this case I had felt that it was no use\nattempting it, but I was not the less put out at the result.Somehow, after twelve o’clock, we both acknowledged to a sated curiosity\nabout the fashions, and to a certain fatigue of body (which was, in\nfact, depression of mind) that indisposed us to go out again.  But still\nwe never spoke of the note; till, all at once, something possessed me to\nask Miss Matty if she would think it her duty to offer sovereigns for\nall the notes of the Town and County Bank she met with?  I could have\nbitten my tongue out the minute I had said it.  She looked up rather\nsadly, and as if I had thrown a new perplexity into her already\ndistressed mind; and for a minute or two she did not speak.  Then she\nsaid—my own dear Miss Matty—without a shade of reproach in her voice—"

I was very thankful to—I was very thankful,\nthat I saw my duty this morning, with the poor man standing by me; but\nits rather a strain upon me to keep thinking and thinking what I should\ndo if such and such a thing happened; and, I believe, I had rather wait\nand see what really does come; and I don’t doubt I shall be helped then\nif I don’t fidget myself, and get too anxious beforehand.  You know,\nlove, I’m not like Deborah.  If Deborah had lived, I’ve no doubt she\nwould have seen after them, before they had got themselves into this\nstate.”We had neither of us much appetite for dinner, though we tried to talk\ncheerfully about indifferent things.  When we returned into the\ndrawing-room, Miss Matty unlocked her desk and began to look over her\naccount-books.  I was so penitent for what I had said in the morning,\nthat I did not choose to take upon myself the presumption to suppose\nthat I could assist her; I rather left her alone, as, with puzzled brow,\nher eye followed her pen up and down the ruled page.  By-and-by she shut\nthe book, locked the desk, and came and drew a chair to mine, where I\nsat in moody sorrow over the fire.  I stole my hand into hers; she\nclasped it, but did not speak a word.  At last she said, with forced\ncomposure in her voice, “If that bank goes wrong, I shall lose one\nhundred and forty-nine pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a year; I\nshall only have thirteen pounds a year left.”  I squeezed her hand hard\nand tight.  I did not know what to say.  Presently (it was too dark to\nsee her face) I felt her fingers work convulsively in my grasp; and I\nknew she was going to speak again.  I heard the sobs in her voice as she\nsaid, “I hope it’s not wrong—not wicked—but, oh!  I am so glad poor\nDeborah is spared this.  She could not have borne to come down in the\nworld—she had such a noble, lofty spirit.”This was all she said about the sister who had insisted upon investing\ntheir little property in that unlucky bank.  We were later in lighting\nthe candle than usual that night, and until that light shamed us into\nspeaking, we sat together very silently and sadly.However, we took to our work after tea with a kind of forced\ncheerfulness (which soon became real as far as it went), talking of that\nnever-ending wonder, Lady Glenmire’s engagement.  Miss Matty was almost\ncoming round to think it a good thing."

I don’t\njudge from my own experience, for my father was neatness itself, and\nwiped his shoes on coming in as carefully as any woman; but still a man\nhas a sort of knowledge of what should be done in difficulties, that it\nis very pleasant to have one at hand ready to lean upon.  Now, Lady\nGlenmire, instead of being tossed about, and wondering where she is to\nsettle, will be certain of a home among pleasant and kind people, such\nas our good Miss Pole and Mrs Forrester.  And Mr Hoggins is really a\nvery personable man; and as for his manners, why, if they are not very\npolished, I have known people with very good hearts and very clever\nminds too, who were not what some people reckoned refined, but who were\nboth true and tender.”She fell off into a soft reverie about Mr Holbrook, and I did not\ninterrupt her, I was so busy maturing a plan I had had in my mind for\nsome days, but which this threatened failure of the bank had brought to\na crisis.  That night, after Miss Matty went to bed, I treacherously\nlighted the candle again, and sat down in the drawing-room to compose a\nletter to the Aga Jenkyns, a letter which should affect him if he were\nPeter, and yet seem a mere statement of dry facts if he were a stranger.\nThe church clock pealed out two before I had done.The next morning news came, both official and otherwise, that the Town\nand County Bank had stopped payment.  Miss Matty was ruined.She tried to speak quietly to me; but when she came to the actual fact\nthat she would have but about five shillings a week to live upon, she\ncould not restrain a few tears.“I am not crying for myself, dear,” said she, wiping them away; “I\nbelieve I am crying for the very silly thought of how my mother would\ngrieve if she could know; she always cared for us so much more than for\nherself.  But many a poor person has less, and I am not very\nextravagant, and, thank God, when the neck of mutton, and Martha’s\nwages, and the rent are paid, I have not a farthing owing.  Poor Martha!\n I think she’ll be sorry to leave me.”Miss Matty smiled at me through her tears, and she would fain have had\nme see only the smile, not the tears.CHAPTER XIV.\nFRIENDS IN NEED"

  "content": "IT was an example to me, and I fancy it might be to many others, to see\nhow immediately Miss Matty set about the retrenchment which she knew to\nbe right under her altered circumstances.  While she went down to speak\nto Martha, and break the intelligence to her, I stole out with my letter\nto the Aga Jenkyns, and went to the signor’s lodgings to obtain the\nexact address.  I bound the signora to secrecy; and indeed her military\nmanners had a degree of shortness and reserve in them which made her\nalways say as little as possible, except when under the pressure of\nstrong excitement.  Moreover (which made my secret doubly sure), the\nsignor was now so far recovered as to be looking forward to travelling\nand conjuring again in the space of a few days, when he, his wife, and\nlittle Phoebe would leave Cranford.  Indeed, I found him looking over a\ngreat black and red placard, in which the Signor Brunoni’s\naccomplishments were set forth, and to which only the name of the town\nwhere he would next display them was wanting.  He and his wife were so\nmuch absorbed in deciding where the red letters would come in with most\neffect (it might have been the Rubric for that matter), that it was some\ntime before I could get my question asked privately, and not before I\nhad given several decisions, the which I questioned afterwards with\nequal wisdom of sincerity as soon as the signor threw in his doubts and\nreasons on the important subject. At last I got the address, spelt by\nsound, and very queer it looked.  I dropped it in the post on my way\nhome, and then for a minute I stood looking at the wooden pane with a\ngaping slit which divided me from the letter but a moment ago in my\nhand.  It was gone from me like life, never to be recalled.  It would\nget tossed about on the sea, and stained with sea-waves perhaps, and be\ncarried among palm-trees, and scented with all tropical fragrance; the\nlittle piece of paper, but an hour ago so familiar and commonplace, had\nset out on its race to the strange wild countries beyond the Ganges!\nBut I could not afford to lose much time on this speculation.  I\nhastened home, that Miss Matty might not miss me. Martha opened the door\nto me, her face swollen with crying.  As soon as she saw me she burst\nout afresh, and taking hold of my arm she pulled me in, and banged the\ndoor to, in order to ask me if indeed it was all true that Miss Matty\nhad been saying."

I could\nnot have had the face to do it, if I’d been her.  I might ha’ been just\nas good for nothing as Mrs Fitz-Adam’s Rosy, who struck for wages after\nliving seven years and a half in one place.  I said I was not one to go\nand serve Mammon at that rate; that I knew when I’d got a good missus,\nif she didn’t know when she’d got a good servant”—“But, Martha,” said I, cutting in while she wiped her eyes.“Don’t, ‘but Martha’ me,” she replied to my deprecatory tone.“Listen to reason”—“I’ll not listen to reason,” she said, now in full possession of her\nvoice, which had been rather choked with sobbing.  “Reason always means\nwhat someone else has got to say.  Now I think what I’ve got to say is\ngood enough reason; but reason or not, I’ll say it, and I’ll stick to\nit. I’ve money in the Savings Bank, and I’ve a good stock of clothes,\nand I’m not going to leave Miss Matty.  No, not if she gives me warning\nevery hour in the day!”She put her arms akimbo, as much as to say she defied me; and, indeed, I\ncould hardly tell how to begin to remonstrate with her, so much did I\nfeel that Miss Matty, in her increasing infirmity, needed the attendance\nof this kind and faithful woman.“Well”—said I at last.“I’m thankful you begin with ‘well!’  If you’d have begun with ‘but,’ as\nyou did afore, I’d not ha’ listened to you.  Now you may go on.”“I know you would be a great loss to Miss Matty, Martha”—“I telled her so.  A loss she’d never cease to be sorry for,” broke in\nMartha triumphantly.“Still, she will have so little—so very little—to live upon, that I\ndon’t see just now how she could find you food—she will even be pressed\nfor her own.  I tell you this, Martha, because I feel you are like a\nfriend to dear Miss Matty, but you know she might not like to have it\nspoken about.”"

  "content": "Apparently this was even a blacker view of the subject than Miss Matty\nhad presented to her, for Martha just sat down on the first chair that\ncame to hand, and cried out loud (we had been standing in the kitchen).At last she put her apron down, and looking me earnestly in the face,\nasked, “Was that the reason Miss Matty wouldn’t order a pudding to-day?\nShe said she had no great fancy for sweet things, and you and she would\njust have a mutton chop.  But I’ll be up to her.  Never you tell, but\nI’ll make her a pudding, and a pudding she’ll like, too, and I’ll pay\nfor it myself; so mind you see she eats it.  Many a one has been\ncomforted in their sorrow by seeing a good dish come upon the table.”I was rather glad that Martha’s energy had taken the immediate and\npractical direction of pudding-making, for it staved off the quarrelsome\ndiscussion as to whether she should or should not leave Miss Matty’s\nservice.  She began to tie on a clean apron, and otherwise prepare\nherself for going to the shop for the butter, eggs, and what else she\nmight require.  She would not use a scrap of the articles already in the\nhouse for her cookery, but went to an old tea-pot in which her private\nstore of money was deposited, and took out what she wanted.I found Miss Matty very quiet, and not a little sad; but by-and-by she\ntried to smile for my sake.  It was settled that I was to write to my\nfather, and ask him to come over and hold a consultation, and as soon as\nthis letter was despatched we began to talk over future plans.  Miss\nMatty’s idea was to take a single room, and retain as much of her\nfurniture as would be necessary to fit up this, and sell the rest, and\nthere to quietly exist upon what would remain after paying the rent.\nFor my part, I was more ambitious and less contented.  I thought of all\nthe things by which a woman, past middle age, and with the education\ncommon to ladies fifty years ago, could earn or add to a living without\nmaterially losing caste; but at length I put even this last clause on\none side, and wondered what in the world Miss Matty could do."

  "content": "Teaching was, of course, the first thing that suggested itself.  If Miss\nMatty could teach children anything, it would throw her among the little\nelves in whom her soul delighted.  I ran over her accomplishments.  Once\nupon a time I had heard her say she could play “Ah! vous dirai-je,\nmaman?” on the piano, but that was long, long ago; that faint shadow of\nmusical acquirement had died out years before.  She had also once been\nable to trace out patterns very nicely for muslin embroidery, by dint of\nplacing a piece of silver paper over the design to be copied, and\nholding both against the window-pane while she marked the scollop and\neyelet-holes.  But that was her nearest approach to the accomplishment\nof drawing, and I did not think it would go very far.  Then again, as to\nthe branches of a solid English education—fancy work and the use of the\nglobes—such as the mistress of the Ladies’ Seminary, to which all the\ntradespeople in Cranford sent their daughters, professed to teach.  Miss\nMatty’s eyes were failing her, and I doubted if she could discover the\nnumber of threads in a worsted-work pattern, or rightly appreciate the\ndifferent shades required for Queen Adelaide’s face in the loyal\nwool-work now fashionable in Cranford.  As for the use of the globes, I\nhad never been able to find it out myself, so perhaps I was not a good\njudge of Miss Matty’s capability of instructing in this branch of\neducation; but it struck me that equators and tropics, and such mystical\ncircles, were very imaginary lines indeed to her, and that she looked\nupon the signs of the Zodiac as so many remnants of the Black Art.What she piqued herself upon, as arts in which she excelled, was making\ncandle-lighters, or “spills” (as she preferred calling them), of\ncoloured paper, cut so as to resemble feathers, and knitting garters in\na variety of dainty stitches.  I had once said, on receiving a present\nof an elaborate pair, that I should feel quite tempted to drop one of\nthem in the street, in order to have it admired; but I found this little\njoke (and it was a very little one) was such a distress to her sense of\npropriety, and was taken with such anxious, earnest alarm, lest the\ntemptation might some day prove too strong for me, that I quite\nregretted having ventured upon it.  A present of these\ndelicately-wrought garters, a bunch of gay “spills,” or a set of cards\non which sewing-silk was wound in a mystical manner, were the well-known\ntokens of Miss Matty’s favour. But would any one pay to have their\nchildren taught these arts? or, indeed, would Miss Matty sell, for\nfilthy lucre, the knack and the skill with which she made trifles of\nvalue to those who loved her?I had to come down to reading, writing, and arithmetic; and, in reading\nthe chapter every morning, she always coughed before coming to long\nwords.  I doubted her power of getting through a genealogical chapter,\nwith any number of coughs.  Writing she did well and delicately—but\nspelling!  She seemed to think that the more out-of-the-way this was,\nand the more trouble it cost her, the greater the compliment she paid to\nher correspondent; and words that she would spell quite correctly in her\nletters to me became perfect enigmas when she wrote to my father.No! there was nothing she could teach to the rising generation of\nCranford, unless they had been quick learners and ready imitators of her\npatience, her humility, her sweetness, her quiet contentment with all\nthat she could not do.  I pondered and pondered until dinner was\nannounced by Martha, with a face all blubbered and swollen with crying."

The\nbread was cut to the imaginary pattern of excellence that existed in\nMiss Matty’s mind, as being the way which her mother had preferred, the\ncurtain was drawn so as to exclude the dead brick wall of a neighbour’s\nstable, and yet left so as to show every tender leaf of the poplar which\nwas bursting into spring beauty.  Martha’s tone to Miss Matty was just\nsuch as that good, rough-spoken servant usually kept sacred for little\nchildren, and which I had never heard her use to any grown-up person.I had forgotten to tell Miss Matty about the pudding, and I was afraid\nshe might not do justice to it, for she had evidently very little\nappetite this day; so I seized the opportunity of letting her into the\nsecret while Martha took away the meat.  Miss Matty’s eyes filled with\ntears, and she could not speak, either to express surprise or delight,\nwhen Martha returned bearing it aloft, made in the most wonderful\nrepresentation of a lion _couchant_ that ever was moulded.  Martha’s\nface gleamed with triumph as she set it down before Miss Matty with an\nexultant “There!”  Miss Matty wanted to speak her thanks, but could not;\nso she took Martha’s hand and shook it warmly, which set Martha off\ncrying, and I myself could hardly keep up the necessary composure.\nMartha burst out of the room, and Miss Matty had to clear her voice once\nor twice before she could speak.  At last she said, “I should like to\nkeep this pudding under a glass shade, my dear!” and the notion of the\nlion _couchant_, with his currant eyes, being hoisted up to the place of\nhonour on a mantelpiece, tickled my hysterical fancy, and I began to\nlaugh, which rather surprised Miss Matty.“I am sure, dear, I have seen uglier things under a glass shade before\nnow,” said she.So had I, many a time and oft, and I accordingly composed my countenance\n(and now I could hardly keep from crying), and we both fell to upon the\npudding, which was indeed excellent—only every morsel seemed to choke\nus, our hearts were so full."

Why should not Miss Matty sell tea—be an agent to\nthe East India Tea Company which then existed?  I could see no\nobjections to this plan, while the advantages were many—always supposing\nthat Miss Matty could get over the degradation of condescending to\nanything like trade.  Tea was neither greasy nor sticky—grease and\nstickiness being two of the qualities which Miss Matty could not endure.\n No shop-window would be required.  A small, genteel notification of her\nbeing licensed to sell tea would, it is true, be necessary, but I hoped\nthat it could be placed where no one would see it.  Neither was tea a\nheavy article, so as to tax Miss Matty’s fragile strength.  The only\nthing against my plan was the buying and selling involved.While I was giving but absent answers to the questions Miss Matty was\nputting—almost as absently—we heard a clumping sound on the stairs, and\na whispering outside the door, which indeed once opened and shut as if\nby some invisible agency.  After a little while Martha came in, dragging\nafter her a great tall young man, all crimson with shyness, and finding\nhis only relief in perpetually sleeking down his hair.“Please, ma’am, he’s only Jem Hearn,” said Martha, by way of an\nintroduction; and so out of breath was she that I imagine she had had\nsome bodily struggle before she could overcome his reluctance to be\npresented on the courtly scene of Miss Matilda Jenkyns’s drawing-room.“And please, ma’am, he wants to marry me off-hand.  And please, ma’am,\nwe want to take a lodger—just one quiet lodger, to make our two ends\nmeet; and we’d take any house conformable; and, oh dear Miss Matty, if I\nmay be so bold, would you have any objections to lodging with us?  Jem\nwants it as much as I do.”  [To Jem ]—“You great oaf! why can’t you back\nme!—But he does want it all the same, very bad—don’t you, Jem?—only, you\nsee, he’s dazed at being called on to speak before quality.”[Picture: Please, ma’am, he wants to marry me off-hand]“It’s not that,” broke in Jem.  “It’s that you’ve taken me all on a\nsudden, and I didn’t think for to get married so soon—and such quick\nwords does flabbergast a man.  It’s not that I’m against it, ma’am”\n(addressing Miss Matty), “only Martha has such quick ways with her when\nonce she takes a thing into her head; and marriage, ma’am—marriage nails\na man, as one may say.  I dare say I shan’t mind it after it’s once\nover.”"

Martha don’t ee! don’t ee! only a man likes to have\nbreathing-time,” said Jem, trying to possess himself of her hand, but in\nvain.  Then seeing that she was more seriously hurt than he had\nimagined, he seemed to try to rally his scattered faculties, and with\nmore straightforward dignity than, ten minutes before, I should have\nthought it possible for him to assume, he turned to Miss Matty, and\nsaid, “I hope, ma’am, you know that I am bound to respect every one who\nhas been kind to Martha.  I always looked on her as to be my wife—some\ntime; and she has often and often spoken of you as the kindest lady that\never was; and though the plain truth is, I would not like to be troubled\nwith lodgers of the common run, yet if, ma’am, you’d honour us by living\nwith us, I’m sure Martha would do her best to make you comfortable; and\nI’d keep out of your way as much as I could, which I reckon would be the\nbest kindness such an awkward chap as me could do.”"

Marriage is such a\nvery solemn thing!”“But Miss Matilda will think of your plan, Martha,” said I, struck with\nthe advantages that it offered, and unwilling to lose the opportunity of\nconsidering about it.  “And I’m sure neither she nor I can ever forget\nyour kindness; nor yours either, Jem.”“Why, yes, ma’am!  I’m sure I mean kindly, though I’m a bit fluttered by\nbeing pushed straight ahead into matrimony, as it were, and mayn’t\nexpress myself conformable.  But I’m sure I’m willing enough, and give\nme time to get accustomed; so, Martha, wench, what’s the use of crying\nso, and slapping me if I come near?”This last was _sotto voce_, and had the effect of making Martha bounce\nout of the room, to be followed and soothed by her lover.  Whereupon\nMiss Matty sat down and cried very heartily, and accounted for it by\nsaying that the thought of Martha being married so soon gave her quite a\nshock, and that she should never forgive herself if she thought she was\nhurrying the poor creature.  I think my pity was more for Jem, of the\ntwo; but both Miss Matty and I appreciated to the full the kindness of\nthe honest couple, although we said little about this, and a good deal\nabout the chances and dangers of matrimony."

And when I came\nto the writing I could hardly understand the meaning, it was so involved\nand oracular.  I made out, however, that I was to go to Miss Pole’s at\neleven o’clock; the number _eleven_ being written in full length as well\nas in numerals, and _A.M._ twice dashed under, as if I were very likely\nto come at eleven at night, when all Cranford was usually abed and\nasleep by ten.  There was no signature except Miss Pole’s initials\nreversed, P.E.; but as Martha had given me the note, “with Miss Pole’s\nkind regards,” it needed no wizard to find out who sent it; and if the\nwriter’s name was to be kept secret, it was very well that I was alone\nwhen Martha delivered it.I went as requested to Miss Pole’s.  The door was opened to me by her\nlittle maid Lizzy in Sunday trim, as if some grand event was impending\nover this work-day.  And the drawing-room upstairs was arranged in\naccordance with this idea.  The table was set out with the best green\ncard-cloth, and writing materials upon it.  On the little chiffonier was\na tray with a newly-decanted bottle of cowslip wine, and some\nladies’-finger biscuits.  Miss Pole herself was in solemn array, as if\nto receive visitors, although it was only eleven o’clock.  Mrs Forrester\nwas there, crying quietly and sadly, and my arrival seemed only to call\nforth fresh tears.  Before we had finished our greetings, performed with\nlugubrious mystery of demeanour, there was another rat-tat-tat, and Mrs\nFitz-Adam appeared, crimson with walking and excitement.  It seemed as\nif this was all the company expected; for now Miss Pole made several\ndemonstrations of being about to open the business of the meeting, by\nstirring the fire, opening and shutting the door, and coughing and\nblowing her nose.  Then she arranged us all round the table, taking care\nto place me opposite to her; and last of all, she inquired of me if the\nsad report was true, as she feared it was, that Miss Matty had lost all\nher fortune?Of course, I had but one answer to make; and I never saw more unaffected\nsorrow depicted on any countenances than I did there on the three before\nme.“I wish Mrs Jamieson was here!” said Mrs Forrester at last; but to judge\nfrom Mrs Fitz-Adam’s face, she could not second the wish."

I imagine we are\nnone of us what may be called rich, though we all possess a genteel\ncompetency, sufficient for tastes that are elegant and refined, and\nwould not, if they could, be vulgarly ostentatious.”  (Here I observed\nMiss Pole refer to a small card concealed in her hand, on which I\nimagine she had put down a few notes.)“Miss Smith,” she continued, addressing me (familiarly known as “Mary”\nto all the company assembled, but this was a state occasion), “I have\nconversed in private—I made it my business to do so yesterday\nafternoon—with these ladies on the misfortune which has happened to our\nfriend, and one and all of us have agreed that while we have a\nsuperfluity, it is not only a duty, but a pleasure—a true pleasure,\nMary!”—her voice was rather choked just here, and she had to wipe her\nspectacles before she could go on—“to give what we can to assist\nher—Miss Matilda Jenkyns.  Only in consideration of the feelings of\ndelicate independence existing in the mind of every refined female”—I\nwas sure she had got back to the card now—“we wish to contribute our\nmites in a secret and concealed manner, so as not to hurt the feelings I\nhave referred to. And our object in requesting you to meet us this\nmorning is that, believing you are the daughter—that your father is, in\nfact, her confidential adviser, in all pecuniary matters, we imagined\nthat, by consulting with him, you might devise some mode in which our\ncontribution could be made to appear the legal due which Miss Matilda\nJenkyns ought to receive from—  Probably your father, knowing her\ninvestments, can fill up the blank.”Miss Pole concluded her address, and looked round for approval and\nagreement.“I have expressed your meaning, ladies, have I not?  And while Miss\nSmith considers what reply to make, allow me to offer you some little\nrefreshment.”"

The worst was, all the ladies\ncried in concert.  Even Miss Pole cried, who had said a hundred times\nthat to betray emotion before any one was a sign of weakness and want of\nself-control.  She recovered herself into a slight degree of impatient\nanger, directed against me, as having set them all off; and, moreover, I\nthink she was vexed that I could not make a speech back in return for\nhers; and if I had known beforehand what was to be said, and had a card\non which to express the probable feelings that would rise in my heart, I\nwould have tried to gratify her.  As it was, Mrs Forrester was the\nperson to speak when we had recovered our composure.“I don’t mind, among friends, stating that I—no!  I’m not poor exactly,\nbut I don’t think I’m what you may call rich; I wish I were, for dear\nMiss Matty’s sake—but, if you please, I’ll write down in a sealed paper\nwhat I can give.  I only wish it was more; my dear Mary, I do indeed.”Now I saw why paper, pens, and ink were provided.  Every lady wrote down\nthe sum she could give annually, signed the paper, and sealed it\nmysteriously.  If their proposal was acceded to, my father was to be\nallowed to open the papers, under pledge of secrecy.  If not, they were\nto be returned to their writers.When the ceremony had been gone through, I rose to depart; but each lady\nseemed to wish to have a private conference with me.  Miss Pole kept me\nin the drawing-room to explain why, in Mrs Jamieson’s absence, she had\ntaken the lead in this “movement,” as she was pleased to call it, and\nalso to inform me that she had heard from good sources that Mrs Jamieson\nwas coming home directly in a state of high displeasure against her\nsister-in-law, who was forthwith to leave her house, and was, she\nbelieved, to return to Edinburgh that very afternoon.  Of course this\npiece of intelligence could not be communicated before Mrs Fitz-Adam,\nmore especially as Miss Pole was inclined to think that Lady Glenmire’s\nengagement to Mr Hoggins could not possibly hold against the blaze of\nMrs Jamieson’s displeasure.  A few hearty inquiries after Miss Matty’s\nhealth concluded my interview with Miss Pole."

At last out it came; the poor old\nlady trembling all the time as if it were a great crime which she was\nexposing to daylight, in telling me how very, very little she had to\nlive upon; a confession which she was brought to make from a dread lest\nwe should think that the small contribution named in her paper bore any\nproportion to her love and regard for Miss Matty.  And yet that sum\nwhich she so eagerly relinquished was, in truth, more than a twentieth\npart of what she had to live upon, and keep house, and a little\nserving-maid, all as became one born a Tyrrell.  And when the whole\nincome does not nearly amount to a hundred pounds, to give up a\ntwentieth of it will necessitate many careful economies, and many pieces\nof self-denial, small and insignificant in the world’s account, but\nbearing a different value in another account-book that I have heard of.\nShe did so wish she was rich, she said, and this wish she kept\nrepeating, with no thought of herself in it, only with a longing,\nyearning desire to be able to heap up Miss Matty’s measure of comforts."

She told me she thought she never could look Miss Matty in the\nface again if she presumed to be giving her so much as she should like\nto do.  “Miss Matty!” continued she, “that I thought was such a fine\nyoung lady when I was nothing but a country girl, coming to market with\neggs and butter and such like things.  For my father, though well-to-do,\nwould always make me go on as my mother had done before me, and I had to\ncome into Cranford every Saturday, and see after sales, and prices, and\nwhat not.  And one day, I remember, I met Miss Matty in the lane that\nleads to Combehurst; she was walking on the footpath, which, you know,\nis raised a good way above the road, and a gentleman rode beside her,\nand was talking to her, and she was looking down at some primroses she\nhad gathered, and pulling them all to pieces, and I do believe she was\ncrying.  But after she had passed, she turned round and ran after me to\nask—oh, so kindly—about my poor mother, who lay on her death-bed; and\nwhen I cried she took hold of my hand to comfort me—and the gentleman\nwaiting for her all the time—and her poor heart very full of something,\nI am sure; and I thought it such an honour to be spoken to in that\npretty way by the rector’s daughter, who visited at Arley Hall.  I have\nloved her ever since, though perhaps I’d no right to do it; but if you\ncan think of any way in which I might be allowed to give a little more\nwithout any one knowing it, I should be so much obliged to you, my dear.\n And my brother would be delighted to doctor her for nothing—medicines,\nleeches, and all.

She had taken very little note of time, however, as she had\nbeen occupied in numberless little arrangements preparatory to the great\nstep of giving up her house.  It was evidently a relief to her to be\ndoing something in the way of retrenchment, for, as she said, whenever\nshe paused to think, the recollection of the poor fellow with his bad\nfive-pound note came over her, and she felt quite dishonest; only if it\nmade her so uncomfortable, what must it not be doing to the directors of\nthe bank, who must know so much more of the misery consequent upon this\nfailure?  She almost made me angry by dividing her sympathy between\nthese directors (whom she imagined overwhelmed by self-reproach for the\nmismanagement of other people’s affairs) and those who were suffering\nlike her.  Indeed, of the two, she seemed to think poverty a lighter\nburden than self-reproach; but I privately doubted if the directors\nwould agree with her.Old hoards were taken out and examined as to their money value which\nluckily was small, or else I don’t know how Miss Matty would have\nprevailed upon herself to part with such things as her mother’s\nwedding-ring, the strange, uncouth brooch with which her father had\ndisfigured his shirt-frill, &c.

What’s your objection?”  And as we had not\ncomprehended anything of what he had proposed, we found it rather\ndifficult to shape our objections; in fact, we never were sure if we had\nany.  So presently Miss Matty got into a nervously acquiescent state,\nand said “Yes,” and “Certainly,” at every pause, whether required or\nnot; but when I once joined in as chorus to a “Decidedly,” pronounced by\nMiss Matty in a tremblingly dubious tone, my father fired round at me\nand asked me “What there was to decide?”  And I am sure to this day I\nhave never known.  But, in justice to him, I must say he had come over\nfrom Drumble to help Miss Matty when he could ill spare the time, and\nwhen his own affairs were in a very anxious state.[Picture: Miss Matty and I sat assenting to accounts]While Miss Matty was out of the room giving orders for luncheon—and\nsadly perplexed between her desire of honouring my father by a delicate,\ndainty meal, and her conviction that she had no right, now that all her\nmoney was gone, to indulge this desire—I told him of the meeting of the\nCranford ladies at Miss Pole’s the day before.  He kept brushing his\nhand before his eyes as I spoke—and when I went back to Martha’s offer\nthe evening before, of receiving Miss Matty as a lodger, he fairly\nwalked away from me to the window, and began drumming with his fingers\nupon it. Then he turned abruptly round, and said, “See, Mary, how a\ngood, innocent life makes friends all around.  Confound it!  I could\nmake a good lesson out of it if I were a parson; but, as it is, I can’t\nget a tail to my sentences—only I’m sure you feel what I want to say.\nYou and I will have a walk after lunch and talk a bit more about these\nplans.”The lunch—a hot savoury mutton-chop, and a little of the cold loin\nsliced and fried—was now brought in.  Every morsel of this last dish was\nfinished, to Martha’s great gratification.  Then my father bluntly told\nMiss Matty he wanted to talk to me alone, and that he would stroll out\nand see some of the old places, and then I could tell her what plan we\nthought desirable.  Just before we went out, she called me back and\nsaid, “Remember, dear, I’m the only one left—I mean, there’s no one to\nbe hurt by what I do.  I’m willing to do anything that’s right and\nhonest; and I don’t think, if Deborah knows where she is, she’ll care so\nvery much if I’m not genteel; because, you see, she’ll know all, dear.\nOnly let me see what I can do, and pay the poor people as far as I’m\nable.”"
