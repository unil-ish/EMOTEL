  "content": "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\nthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\nfitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\ncontinually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\naffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\ngave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\nindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\nthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\nthese was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\npenury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\ndoor was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\nfurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\noccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at\nand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\nwhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\nof men.In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills\nare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\nplains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\ntroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\ninfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\nirksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\nlaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\nin order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in\nwhich I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of\nenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\nmind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\nwere shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in\ncold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands."

  "content": "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\na solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\nthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\ngrew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my\npersecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\nto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\ndreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\ncreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\nadvanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\nin my bosom.Chapter 20I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\nrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\nremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my\nlabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention\nto it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to\nconsider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was\nengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled\nbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest\nremorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was\nalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her\nmate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had\nsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she\nhad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and\nreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her\ncreation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\nloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\nfor it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn\nwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,\nand he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\ndeserted by one of his own species."

  "content": "Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,\nyet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon\nthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon\nthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a\ncondition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,\nto inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved\nby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\nhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\npromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\nas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\nthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\nthe light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\nwhich he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\nfulfilment of my promise.As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\nmalice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\nhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\nsought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\nthe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\nterrible reveries.Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\nof voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\nperson landed close to my house."

I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\nof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\nendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he\napproached me and said in a smothered voice,“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\nintend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;\nI left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\nits willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many\nmonths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have\nendured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\nhopes?”“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\nunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\nday will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;\nobey!”“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\narrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\nvice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose\ndelight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your\nwords will only exasperate my rage.”"

I had\nfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\nMan! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\nand soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\never. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\nwretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\nremains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\nfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\nmisery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\nthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.”“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\nI have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend\nbeneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\nwedding-night.”I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\nprecipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\nacross the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\nwaves.All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\nwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\nfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\nto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\nto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\nAnd then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on\nyour wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\nextinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\nthought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\nshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\nhad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\nbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle."

  "content": "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\nthe depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\nnight’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\ncreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\ndesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\nbut uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\nbe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\ndæmon whom I had myself created.I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\nloved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the\nsun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\nsleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\nwere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\ninto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\nif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\nreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\nwords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\nlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\njoin him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\nhe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\nhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\nIndian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\nhis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\nconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\nmy society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to\nleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\nsouthwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\nI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days."

  "content": "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\nto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\nmust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\nhandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\nmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\nof my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\ndestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\nmangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\nthen entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\nwork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\nput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\nup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\nmeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\nchemical apparatus.Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\nhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\nclearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\nmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\nconclusion.Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\nThe scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\nbut I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\ndreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\nfellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\nsuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\ndarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\nas it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\nthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\nrising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\nthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\ndirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\nmoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\nkeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\nslept soundly."

  "content": "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\nthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\nthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\nwhich I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\nthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\nwater. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\nconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\nand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\nworld that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\nwide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\nthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\nbeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\nmy other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\nthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\nsea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\ntask is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\nof Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\nsanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\ndespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\nclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\nfree from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\nland towards the south.Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\nfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\nwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\nof life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\npart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\nwild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\nthe traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\nsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\ncarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\nlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\nextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\nwhere I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\nme. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\nharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\nescape.As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\npeople crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\nappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\na slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\nspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My\ngood friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\nthis town and inform me where I am?”"

  "content": "“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\n“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\nbut you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\nstranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\nangry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so\nroughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\nreceive strangers so inhospitably.”“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\nEnglish may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\nincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\nannoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\nno one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\ncrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\napproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\nfollow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not\nthis a free country?”“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\nand you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\nfound murdered here last night.”This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\nthat could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\nand was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\nfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\nto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\napprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\nwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\nall fear of ignominy or death.I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\nthe frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\nrecollection.Chapter 21"

  "content": "I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\nbenevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\nwith some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\nhe asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\nmagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\nhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\nfor port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\nnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\ntwo miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\nand his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\nalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\nlength on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\nlight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\nwho was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\ncorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\nwaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\nthat the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\nof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\nto life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\nyears of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\nany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\nmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\nsupport. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\nan unfavourable augury from my manner."

  "content": "The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\ncalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\nsaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\nand as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\nboat in which I had just landed.A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\nof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\nbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\nonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\nwas afterwards found.Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\nbody into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and\nrubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\nquite gone.Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\nBesides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\nfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\nthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\nof the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\nthe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\neffect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\nsuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\nmurder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\nand several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\nstrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\nknowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\ninhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\ntranquil as to the consequences of the affair."

  "content": "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\ncan I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\nhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\nagony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\npassed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\nClerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\nthe body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\nalso, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\nvictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\nbenefactor—”The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\nI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\nattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\ntormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\nmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\nmy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\nbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\nsink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\nchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\nnext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\nmade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\nthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\na dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\nand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\nwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly."

  "content": "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\nme. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\nthat class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\nand the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.“Are you better now, sir?” said she.I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.”“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none\nof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\nwith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\nlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\nof reality.As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\nthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\nsecond. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\nhangman who would gain his fee?These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\nshown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\nto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\nhad provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\nsee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\nevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\nmiserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\nthat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\nintervals."

  "content": "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\nHis countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\nmine and addressed me in French,“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\nmake you more comfortable?”“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\nthe most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and\nhave been, can death be any evil to me?”“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\nstrange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\nseized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\npresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\nunaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\nyour path.”As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\nthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\nthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\nto say,“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\nyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\nand illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\ndiscovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\nto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\nkind.”"

I put my hand before my eyes,\nand cried out in agony,“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\nlet him enter!”Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\nrather a severe tone,“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\nwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\nfrom anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how\nvery kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\narrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\ncheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\nsaid he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\nof the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\nto pursue you. And poor Clerval—”"

Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\nmost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\nshould have died on the coffin of Henry.”We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\ncould ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\ngradually recovered my health.As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\nfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\ninto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\nrelapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\nlife? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\ndrawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\nthrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\nme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\nsink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\nwish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\nmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\nmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins."

  "content": "The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\nin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\ntown where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\ncare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\nthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\nbrought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\npalace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\nthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\norbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\nfirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\nof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\nthese words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\nwish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\ncousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\nchildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\ndespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\nexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence."

  "content": "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\ntriumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\nI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\nchance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\nblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\nthe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\nmockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\ndelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\njourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My\nstrength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\npreyed upon my wasted frame.Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\nmy father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\nbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\nIt was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\nthe dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\nto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\nwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly."

Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\nswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\nnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\nthousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\nof nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\nmyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\nwatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\nsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\nand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\nforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\nsusceptible.Chapter 22The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\ncould continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to\nseek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not\nabhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right\nto share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\nvarious arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I\nfelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\nmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. \nHuman beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\na wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\nas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\nof this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all\ndied by my hands.”"

  "content": "My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\nitself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\nconvalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\nconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\nsupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\nhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\nhis breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\nsilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\nYet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\nfrom me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\nrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,\n“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat\nyou never to make such an assertion again.”“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\nsacrifice the whole human race.”The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\nIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\nmisfortunes.As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost\nself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\nto the sea of ice.A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the\nfollowing letter from Elizabeth:“My dear Friend,“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you\nmust have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than\nwhen you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,\ntortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\nyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\ncomfort and tranquillity."
