  "content": "\"It's so dreadful to be poor!\" sighed Meg, looking down at her old\ndress.\"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things,\nand other girls nothing at all,\" added little Amy, with an injured\nsniff.\"We've got father and mother and each other,\" said Beth contentedly,\nfrom her corner.The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the\ncheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,--\"We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She\ndidn't say \"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of\nfather far away, where the fighting was.Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,--\"You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this\nChristmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one; and\nshe thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are\nsuffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little\nsacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't;\" and Meg\nshook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she\nwanted.\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\nthat. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want\nto buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I've wanted it _so_ long,\" said\nJo, who was a bookworm.\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\nwhich no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing-pencils; I really need them,\"\nsaid Amy decidedly.\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\ngive up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun;\nI'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels\nof her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when\nI'm longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\nagain."

  "content": "\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\nfly out of the window or cry?\"\"It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\ntidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get\nso stiff, I can't practise well at all;\" and Beth looked at her rough\nhands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy; \"for you don't\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't\nknow your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if\nhe isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\"If you mean _libel_, I'd say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if\npapa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be _statirical_ about it. It's\nproper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_,\" returned Amy,\nwith dignity.\"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money\npapa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we'd be,\nif we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\nspite of their money.\"\"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,\nwe make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\nthe long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her\nhands in her pockets, and began to whistle.\"Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!\"\"That's why I do it.\"\"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!\"\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\"'Birds in their little nests agree,'\" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\n\"pecking\" ended for that time."

  "content": "\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much\nwhen you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your\nhair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\"I'm not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\ntails till I'm twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\na chestnut mane. \"I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss\nMarch, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It's bad\nenough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and\nmanners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it's\nworse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with papa, and I can\nonly stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!\" And Jo shook the\nblue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball\nbounded across the room.\"Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped; so you must try to be\ncontented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\ngirls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that\nall the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in\nits touch.\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular and\nprim. Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an affected little\ngoose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways\nof speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but your absurd words are\nas bad as Jo's slang.\"\"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\nready to share the lecture.\"You're a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly; and no one\ncontradicted her, for the \"Mouse\" was the pet of the family.As young readers like to know \"how people look,\" we will take this\nmoment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\nknitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\nwithout, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable\nold room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for\na good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\nchrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\npleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it."

  "content": "Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\nplump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet\nmouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\nJo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she\nnever seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\nmuch in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\ngray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\nfunny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it\nwas usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders\nhad Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the\nuncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\nwoman, and didn't like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\nher--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\nmanner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom\ndisturbed. Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name\nsuited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her\nown, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,\nthough the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at\nleast. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling\non her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a\nyoung lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four\nsisters were we will leave to be found out.The clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\nof slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good\neffect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened\nto welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out\nof the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was\nas she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.[Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]\"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair.\"\"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.\"I'm the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--\"I'm the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the\nslippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was\ngone.\"\"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Beth; \"let's each get her something\nfor Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"\"That's like you, dear! What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.Every one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the\nidea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give\nher a nice pair of gloves.\"\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\"I'll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won't cost\nmuch, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\nDon't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.[Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my\n                     turn to sit in the big chair]"

I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\ndreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\" said\nBeth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise\nher. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to\ndo about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up and down,\nwith her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.\"I don't mean to act any more after this time; I'm getting too old for\nsuch things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\n\"dressing-up\" frolics.\"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\nwith your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\nactress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\nboards,\" said Jo. \"We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do\nthe fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\"I can't help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don't choose to make\nmyself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down\neasily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\ngraceful; I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\" returned\nAmy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she\nwas small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.[Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]\"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\ncrying frantically, 'Roderigo! save me! save me!'\" and away went Jo,\nwith a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked\nherself along as if she went by machinery; and her \"Ow!\" was more\nsuggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave\na despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread\nburn as she watched the fun, with interest.\"It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the\naudience laugh, don't blame me. Come on, Meg.\""

You're\na regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her\nsisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly. \"I do think 'The Witch's Curse, an\nOperatic Tragedy,' is rather a nice thing; but I'd like to try Macbeth,\nif we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing\npart. 'Is that a dagger that I see before me?'\" muttered Jo, rolling her\neyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.\"No, it's the toasting fork, with mother's shoe on it instead of the\nbread. Beth's stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\ngeneral burst of laughter.\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,\nand actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady, with a\n\"can-I-help-you\" look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\nelegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\ngray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\nthe world.\"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,\ngetting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn't come home to\ndinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look\ntired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\"While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off,\nher warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy-chair, drew Amy to\nher lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls\nflew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg\narranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,\noverturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and\nfro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave\ndirections to every one, as she sat with her hands folded."

He sends all sorts of loving\nwishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\nMarch, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\"Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger, and simper\nover your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking in her tea, and dropping her\nbread, butter side down, on the carpet, in her haste to get at the\ntreat.Beth ate no more, but crept away, to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\nover the delight to come, till the others were ready.\"I think it was so splendid in father to go as a chaplain when he was\ntoo old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\nwarmly.\"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a _vivan_--what's its name? or a\nnurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\nbad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\nher voice.\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his\nwork faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a\nminute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.\"They all drew to the fire, mother in the big chair with Beth at her\nfeet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\nthe back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\nshould happen to be touching."

In this one little\nwas said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the\nhomesickness conquered; it was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of\nlively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news; and only\nat the end did the writer's heart overflow with fatherly love and\nlonging for the little girls at home.[Illustration: It was a cheerful, hopeful letter]\"Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by\nday, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection\nat all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but\nremind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days\nneed not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that\nthey will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully,\nfight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so\nbeautifully, that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder\nthan ever of my little women.\"Everybody sniffed when they came to that part; Jo wasn't ashamed of the\ngreat tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded\nthe rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother's shoulder\nand sobbed out, \"I _am_ a selfish girl! but I'll truly try to be better,\nso he mayn't be disappointed in me by and by.\"\"We all will!\" cried Meg. \"I think too much of my looks, and hate to\nwork, but won't any more, if I can help it.\"\"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman,' and not be\nrough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\nelse,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\nharder task than facing a rebel or two down South.Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army-sock, and\nbegan to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\nlay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\nthat father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\ncoming home.[Illustration: How you used to play Pilgrim's Progress]"

If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it\nover again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\nat the mature age of twelve.\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\nplaying all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our\nroad is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\nguide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\nwhich is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\nbegin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get\nbefore father comes home.\"\"Really, mother? Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\nliteral young lady.\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth; I rather\nthink she hasn't got any,\" said her mother.\"Yes, I have; mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\npianos, and being afraid of people.\"Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh; but\nnobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully. \"It is only another name for\ntrying to be good, and the story may help us; for though we do want to\nbe good, it's hard work, and we forget, and don't do our best.\""

No\nstockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\ndisappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because\nit was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother's\npromise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little\ncrimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful\nold story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true\nguide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a\n\"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her pillow. A\ngreen-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few\nwords written by their mother, which made their one present very\nprecious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find\ntheir little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat\nlooking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the\ncoming day.In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\nwhich unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her\nvery tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to\nthe two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"mother wants us to\nread and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used\nto be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war\ntrouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you\nplease; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little\nevery morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help\nme through the day.\"Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round\nher, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\nso seldom seen on her restless face.\"How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the\nhard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,\"\nwhispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters'\nexample.\"I'm glad mine is blue,\" said Amy; and then the rooms were very still\nwhile the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\ntouch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\"Where is mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\ntheir gifts, half an hour later.\"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin', and your ma went\nstraight off to see what was needed. There never _was_ such a woman for\ngivin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',\" replied Hannah, who\nhad lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them\nall more as a friend than a servant."

Hannah washed and ironed\nthem for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\nat the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\"Bless the child! she's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\nMarch.' How funny!\" cried Jo, taking up one.\"Isn't it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\ninitials are 'M. M.,' and I don't want any one to use these but Marmee,\"\nsaid Beth, looking troubled.\"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for\nno one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,\" said\nMeg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\"There's mother. Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed,\nand steps sounded in the hall.Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\nall waiting for her.\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,\nsurprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\nearly.\"Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean any one should know till the time\ncame. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave\n_all_ my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any\nmore.\"As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\none; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\nherself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \"a\ntrump,\" while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\nornament the stately bottle.\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\nbeing good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\nminute I was up: and I'm _so_ glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\""

That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't\nget any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think\nthere were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry\nlittle girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves\nwith bread and milk on Christmas morning.\"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\nMeg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs\ncollecting clothes for the poor Hummels.Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\nthe few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white\nchrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\nquite an elegant air to the table.\"She's coming!

Being\nstill too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to\nafford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\nwits to work, and--necessity being the mother of invention,--made\nwhatever they needed. Very clever were some of their\nproductions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned\nbutter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,\nglittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered\nwith the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids\nof tin preserve-pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being\nturned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent\nrevels.No gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart's\ncontent, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots\ngiven her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,\nan old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\npicture, were Jo's chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions. The\nsmallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\nto take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit\nfor the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\nwhisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.\nIt was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and\nemployed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or\nspent in less profitable society.On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the\ndress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\nmost flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling\nand whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an\noccasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\nexcitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\napart, and the Operatic Tragedy began."

This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus\nfor walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot\non it, and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark, and the\nglow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\nfrom the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed\nfor the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with\na clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious\ncloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he\nstruck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his\nhatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to\nkill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an\noccasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,\nand the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with\nthe air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and\nordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding \"What ho, minion! I need\nthee!\"[Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]Out came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and\nblack robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded\na potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in\na fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the\nspirit who would bring the love philter:--\"Hither, hither, from thy home,\n         Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\n         Born of roses, fed on dew,\n         Charms and potions canst thou brew?\n         Bring me here, with elfin speed,\n         The fragrant philter which I need;\n         Make it sweet and swift and strong,\n         Spirit, answer now my song!\"[Illustration: A little figure in cloudy white]A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\nappeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\nhair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang,--\"Hither I come,\n          From my airy home,\n        Afar in the silver moon.\n          Take the magic spell,\n          And use it well,\n        Or its power will vanish soon!\"And, dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit\nvanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a\nlovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having\ncroaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a\nmocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\nboots, Hugo departed; and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had\nkilled a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed him, and\nintends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain\nfell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits\nof the play."
