Old Mr. Laurence sent it,\" replied Mrs. March.\"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into\nhis head? We don't know him!\" exclaimed Meg.\"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an\nodd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father, years ago;\nand he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would\nallow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending\nthem a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse; and so you\nhave a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk\nbreakfast.\"\"That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He's a capital fellow,\nand I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he'd like to know us;\nbut he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when\nwe pass,\" said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt\nout of sight, with \"Ohs!\" and \"Ahs!\" of satisfaction.\"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you?\"\nasked one of the girls. \"My mother knows old Mr. Laurence; but says he's\nvery proud, and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his\ngrandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor, and\nmakes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn't\ncome. Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.\"\"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the\nfence, and were getting on capitally,--all about cricket, and so\non,--when he saw Meg coming, and walked off.

This was Jo's favorite refuge; and here she loved to retire with\nhalf a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society\nof a pet rat who lived near by, and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg\nappeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her\ncheeks, and waited to hear the news.\"Such fun! only see! a regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for\nto-morrow night!\" cried Meg, waving the precious paper, and then\nproceeding to read it, with girlish delight.\"'Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a\nlittle dance on New-Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go; now\nwhat _shall_ we wear?\"\"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins,\nbecause we haven't got anything else?\" answered Jo, with her mouth full.\"If I only had a silk!\" sighed Meg. \"Mother says I may when I'm\neighteen, perhaps; but two years is an everlasting time to wait.\""

Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch\nthe papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.[Illustration: Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks]\"Ought they to smoke like that?\" asked Beth, from her perch on the bed.\"It's the dampness drying,\" replied Jo.\"What a queer smell! it's like burnt feathers,\" observed Amy, smoothing\nher own pretty curls with a superior air.\"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little\nringlets,\" said Jo, putting down the tongs.She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the\nhair came with the papers, and the horrified hair-dresser laid a row of\nlittle scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.\"Oh, oh, oh! what _have_ you done? I'm spoilt! I can't go! My hair, oh,\nmy hair!\" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her\nforehead.\"Just my luck! you shouldn't have asked me to do it; I always spoil\neverything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made a\nmess,\" groaned poor Jo, regarding the black pancakes with tears of\nregret.\"It isn't spoilt; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come\non your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I've\nseen many girls do it so,\" said Amy consolingly.\"Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone,\"\ncried Meg petulantly.\"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,\"\nsaid Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep."

Meg knew Sallie, and was at her\nease very soon; but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish\ngossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt\nas much out of place as a colt in a flower-garden. Half a dozen jovial\nlads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she\nlonged to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.\nShe telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly\nthat she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the\ngroup near her dwindled away, till she was left alone. She could not\nroam about and amuse herself, for the burnt breadth would show, so she\nstared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked\nat once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would\nhave guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big\nred-headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage\nher, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy\nherself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the\nsame refuge; for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face\nto face with the \"Laurence boy.\"[Illustration: Face to face with the Laurence boy]\"Dear me, I didn't know any one was here!\" stammered Jo, preparing to\nback out as speedily as she had bounced in.But the boy laughed, and said pleasantly, though he looked a little\nstartled,--\"Don't mind me; stay, if you like.\"\"Sha'n't I disturb you?\"\"Not a bit; I only came here because I don't know many people, and felt\nrather strange at first, you know.\"\"So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.\"The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to\nbe polite and easy,--\"I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before; you live near us,\ndon't you?\"\"Next door\"; and he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner\nwas rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket\nwhen he brought the cat home.That put Jo at her ease; and she laughed too, as she said, in her\nheartiest way,--\"We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.\"\"Grandpa sent it.\"\"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?\"\"How is your cat, Miss March?\" asked the boy, trying to look sober,\nwhile his black eyes shone with fun.\"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo,\"\nreturned the young lady.\"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.\"\"Laurie Laurence,--what an odd name!\"\"My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called\nme Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.\"\"I hate my name, too--so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo,\ninstead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?\"\"I thrashed 'em.\"\"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it\"; and\nJo resigned herself with a sigh.\"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?\" asked Laurie, looking as if he\nthought the name suited her."

Don't you dance?\"\"Sometimes; you see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been\ninto company enough yet to know how you do things here.\"\"Abroad!\" cried Jo. \"Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people\ndescribe their travels.\"Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin; but Jo's eager questions soon\nset him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where\nthe boys never wore hats, and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for\nholiday fun went walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.\"Don't I wish I'd been there!\" cried Jo. \"Did you go to Paris?\"\"We spent last winter there.\"\"Can you talk French?\"\"We were not allowed to speak any thing else at Vevay.\"\"Do say some!

Laurie's bashfulness soon wore\noff; for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and\nJo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten, and nobody\nlifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the \"Laurence boy\" better than\never, and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him\nto the girls; for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys\nwere almost unknown creatures to them.\"Curly black hair; brown skin; big, black eyes; handsome nose; fine\nteeth; small hands and feet; taller than I am; very polite, for a boy,\nand altogether jolly.

The hall was\nempty, and they had a grand polka; for Laurie danced well, and taught\nher the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring.\nWhen the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath;\nand Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students' festival at\nHeidelberg, when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and\nJo reluctantly followed her into a side-room, where she found her on a\nsofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.[Illustration: They sat down on the stairs]\"I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned, and gave me a sad\nwrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm ever\ngoing to get home,\" she said, rocking to and fro in pain.\"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry.

Slipping out, she ran down,\nand, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage.

Now then, Meg!\" and Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims\nwere not setting out as they ought to do.They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was\nalways at the window, to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them.\nSomehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without\nthat; for, whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that\nmotherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.\"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would\nserve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never\nseen,\" cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and\nbitter wind."

Thank goodness, I can\nalways find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but\ncome home jolly, there's a dear.\"Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for\nthe day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm\nturn-over, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather,\nhard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth."

Believing that they could not begin too\nearly to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents\nconsented, and both fell to work with the hearty good-will which in\nspite of all obstacles, is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a\nplace as nursery governess, and felt rich with her small salary. As she\nsaid, she _was_ \"fond of luxury,\" and her chief trouble was poverty. She\nfound it harder to bear than the others, because she could remember a\ntime when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want\nof any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it\nwas very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay\nfriends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw\nall she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg\ncaught frequent glimpses of dainty ball-dresses and bouquets, heard\nlively gossip about theatres, concerts, sleighing parties, and\nmerry-makings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which\nwould have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a\nsense of injustice made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes, for\nshe had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which\nalone can make life happy.Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame, and needed an active\nperson to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one\nof the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her\noffer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost\nall chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will; but the\nunworldly Marches only said,--\"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will\nkeep together and be happy in one another.\"The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo\nat a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck\nthe old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This\ndid not suit Jo at all; but she accepted the place since nothing better\nappeared, and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well with her\nirascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo had\nmarched home, declaring she couldn't bear it any longer; but Aunt March\nalways cleared up quickly, and sent for her back again with such urgency\nthat she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery\nold lady."

Jo remembered\nthe kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges\nwith his big dictionaries, tell her stories about the queer pictures in\nhis Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in\nthe street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the\ntall book-cases, the cosy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the\nwilderness of books, in which she could wander where she liked, made the\nlibrary a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap, or\nwas busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling\nherself up in the easy-chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,\ntravels, and pictures, like a regular book-worm. But, like all\nhappiness, it did not last long; for as sure as she had just reached the\nheart of the story, the sweetest verse of the song, or the most perilous\nadventure of her traveller, a shrill voice called, \"Josy-phine!\nJosy-phine!\" and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the\npoodle, or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.[Illustration: Curling herself up in the big chair]Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid; what it was she had no\nidea, as yet, but left it for time to tell her; and, meanwhile, found\nher greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and\nride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless\nspirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series\nof ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training\nshe received at Aunt March's was just what she needed; and the thought\nthat she was doing something to support herself made her happy, in spite\nof the perpetual \"Josy-phine!\""

Even when he went away, and her mother was called to\ndevote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went\nfaithfully on by herself, and did the best she could. She was a\nhousewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and\ncomfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be\nloved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little\nworld was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy\nbee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for\nBeth was a child still, and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one\nwhole or handsome one among them; all were outcasts till Beth took them\nin; for, when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her,\nbecause Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the\nmore tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm\ndolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals; no harsh words\nor blows were ever given them; no neglect ever saddened the heart of the\nmost repulsive: but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed, with\nan affection which never failed. One forlorn fragment of _dollanity_ had\nbelonged to Jo; and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in\nthe rag-bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth, and\ntaken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat\nlittle cap, and, as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these\ndeficiencies by folding it in a blanket, and devoting her best bed to\nthis chronic invalid. If any one had known the care lavished on that\ndolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they\nlaughed. She brought it bits of bouquets; she read to it, took it out to\nbreathe the air, hidden under her coat; she sung it lullabys, and never\nwent to bed without kissing its dirty face, and whispering tenderly, \"I\nhope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.\""

She loved\nmusic so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practised away so patiently\nat the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if some one (not to\nhint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw\nBeth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune,\nwhen she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work,\nnever was too tired to play for Marmee and the girls, and day after day\nsaid hopefully to herself, \"I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm\ngood.\"There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners\ntill needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the\nsacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the\nsweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she\nwould have answered at once, \"My nose.\" When she was a baby, Jo had\naccidentally dropped her into the coal-hod, and Amy insisted that the\nfall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big, nor red, like poor\n\"Petrea's\"; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world\ncould not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself,\nand it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a\nGrecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself."

Her\nteachers complained that, instead of doing her sums, she covered her\nslate with animals; the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps\non; and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering\nout of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as\nwell as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of\ndeportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being\ngood-tempered, and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort.\nHer little airs and graces were much admired, so were her\naccomplishments; for beside her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,\ncrochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two thirds of\nthe words. She had a plaintive way of saying, \"When papa was rich we did\nso-and-so,\" which was very touching; and her long words were considered\n\"perfectly elegant\" by the girls.Amy was in a fair way to be spoilt; for every one petted her, and her\nsmall vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing,\nhowever, rather quenched the vanities; she had to wear her cousin's\nclothes. Now Florence's mamma hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy\nsuffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet,\nunbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was\ngood, well made, and little worn; but Amy's artistic eyes were much\nafflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull\npurple, with yellow dots, and no trimming.\"My only comfort,\" she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, \"is, that\nmother don't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria\nParks' mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful; for sometimes she is\nso bad, her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school. When\nI think of this _deggerredation_, I feel that I can bear even my flat\nnose and purple gown, with yellow sky-rockets on it.\"Meg was Amy's confidant and monitor, and, by some strange attraction of\nopposites, Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her\nthoughts; and over her big, harum-scarum sister, Beth unconsciously\nexercised more influence than any one in the family. The two older girls\nwere a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger into\nher keeping, and watched over her in her own way; \"playing mother\" they\ncalled it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls, with\nthe maternal instinct of little women.\"Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day I'm\nreally dying for some amusement,\" said Meg, as they sat sewing together\nthat evening."

I actually made myself sleepy; and, before she\nbegan to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by\nopening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.[Illustration: Reading that everlasting Belsham]\"'I wish I could, and be done with it,' said I, trying not to be saucy.\"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and\nthink them over while she just 'lost' herself for a moment. She never\nfinds herself very soon; so the minute her cap began to bob, like a\ntop-heavy dahlia, I whipped the 'Vicar of Wakefield' out of my pocket,\nand read away, with one eye on him, and one on aunt. I'd just got to\nwhere they all tumbled into the water, when I forgot, and laughed out\nloud. Aunt woke up; and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me\nto read a bit, and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy\nand instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though\nshe only said,--\"'I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it, child.'\"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could.\nOnce I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly,\n'I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am; sha'n't I stop now?'\"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me\na sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way,--\"'Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss.'\"\"Did she own she liked it?\" asked Meg.\"Oh, bless you, no! but she let old Belsham rest; and, when I ran back\nafter my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that\nshe didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall, because of the\ngood time coming.

At the Kings to-day I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the\nchildren said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and\npapa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking\nvery loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed\nme, so I shouldn't see how red their eyes were.

Not one! They sat as still as mice; and Susie cried quarts, I\nknow she did. I didn't envy her then; for I felt that millions of\ncarnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy, after that.

A poor woman came\nin, with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do\nsome scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her\nchildren, and had been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a\nhurry, and said 'No,' rather crossly; so she was going away, looking\nhungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the\ncrooked end of his cane, and held it out to her. She was so glad and\nsurprised, she took it right in her arms, and thanked him over and over.\nHe told her to 'go along and cook it,' and she hurried off, so happy!\nWasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big,\nslippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be 'aisy.'\"[Illustration: Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish]When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one;\nand, after a moment's thought, she said soberly,--\"As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets to-day, at the rooms, I felt\nvery anxious about father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should\nbe, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do; but I\nkept on worrying, till an old man came in, with an order for some\nclothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him; for he looked\npoor and tired and anxious.\"'Have you sons in the army?' I asked; for the note he brought was not\nto me.\"'Yes, ma'am.

I'd given one man, and thought it\ntoo much, while he gave four, without grudging them. I had all my girls\nto comfort me at home; and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say\n'good by' to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy, thinking of my\nblessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and\nthanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.\"\"Tell another story, mother,--one with a moral to it, like this.
