  "content": "If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on\nTuesday,--an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last\ndegree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which\nis more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a\nlittle, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late\nfor any one else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people\nout of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be\ngot in order. The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby; but\nwithout stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skilfully made the\nbest of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the\ncarpet, covering stains on the walls with pictures framed in ivy, and\nfilling up empty corners with home-made statuary, which gave an artistic\nair to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.The lunch looked charmingly; and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped\nit would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver\nwould get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and mother\nwere all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the\nscenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, an\naching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything\nwould allow, and, as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with\nanticipations of the happy moment, when, lunch safely over, she should\ndrive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights; for\nthe \"cherry-bounce\" and the broken bridge were her strong points.Then came two hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor\nto porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart\nshower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young\nladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came; and at two the\nexhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the\nperishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.\"No doubt about the weather to-day; they will certainly come, so we must\nfly round and be ready for them,\" said Amy, as the sun woke her next\nmorning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had\nsaid nothing about Tuesday, for her interest, like her cake, was getting\na little stale.\"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad to-day,\"\nsaid Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of\nplacid despair.\"Use the chicken, then; the toughness won't matter in a salad,\" advised\nhis wife.\"Hannah left it on the kitchen-table a minute, and the kittens got at\nit. I'm very sorry, Amy,\" added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.\"Then I _must_ have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do,\" said Amy\ndecidedly.\"Shall I rush into town and demand one?\" asked Jo, with the magnanimity\nof a martyr."

  "content": "\"You'd come bringing it home under your arm, without any paper, just to\ntry me. I'll go myself,\" answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to\nfail.Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel travelling-basket, she\ndeparted, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit, and\nfit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her\ndesire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing, to prevent further\nloss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her own\nforethought.As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady,\nAmy pocketed her veil, and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to\nfind out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card\nfull of refractory figures that she did not observe a new-comer, who\nentered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said,\n\"Good-morning, Miss March,\" and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's\nmost elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he would get out\nbefore she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and,\ncongratulating herself that she had on her new travelling dress,\nreturned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.They got on excellently; for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by\nlearning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away\nin a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling to\nthe door, she upset the basket, and--oh, horror!--the lobster, in all\nits vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a\nTudor.\"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!\" cried the unconscious youth,\npoking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing\nto hand out the basket after the old lady.\"Please don't--it's--it's mine,\" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red\nas her fish.[Illustration: Please don't, it's mine]\"Oh, really, I beg pardon; it's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?\" said\nTudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that\ndid credit to his breeding.Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat,\nand said, laughing,--"

Feeling that the neighbors were interested\nin her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday's\nfailure by a grand success to-day; so she ordered the \"cherry-bounce,\"\nand drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.\"There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go into the porch to meet\nthem; it looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time\nafter all her trouble,\" said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word.\nBut after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression,\nfor, looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.\"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table; it will\nbe too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl,\" cried\nJo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even for a\nlaugh."

The remodelled lunch being gayly partaken of, the\nstudio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy\nordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce!) and drove her\nfriend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when \"the party went\nout.\"As she came walking in, looking very tired, but as composed as ever, she\nobserved that every vestige of the unfortunate _fête_ had disappeared,\nexcept a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.\"You've had a lovely afternoon for your drive, dear,\" said her mother,\nas respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.\"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I\nthought,\" observed Beth, with unusual warmth.\"Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so\nmuch company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,\" asked Meg\nsoberly.\"Take it all; I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will\nmould before I can dispose of it,\" answered Amy, thinking with a sigh of\nthe generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.\"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us,\" began Jo, as they sat down\nto ice-cream and salad for the second time in two days.A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the\nwhole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,\n\"Salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn\"--here\na general explosion of laughter cut short the \"history of sallets,\" to\nthe great surprise of the learned gentleman.\"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels: Germans\nlike messes. I'm sick of the sight of this; and there's no reason you\nshould all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool,\" cried Amy, wiping\nher eyes.\"I thought I _should_ have died when I saw you two girls rattling about\nin the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big nutshell,\nand mother waiting in state to receive the throng,\" sighed Jo, quite\nspent with laughter.\"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to\nsatisfy you,\" said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret."

Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would\nhave given more real happiness than did the little sum that came to her\nin this wise.Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her\nscribbling suit, and \"fall into a vortex,\" as she expressed it, writing\naway at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was\nfinished she could find no peace. Her \"scribbling suit\" consisted of a\nblack woollen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a\ncap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which\nshe bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap\nwas a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these\nperiods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads\nsemi-occasionally, to ask, with interest, \"Does genius burn, Jo?\" They\ndid not always venture even to ask this question, but took an\nobservation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive\narticle of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that\nhard work was going on; in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly\naskew; and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and\ncast upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew; and\nnot until the red bow was seen gayly erect upon the gifted brow, did any\none dare address Jo."

  "content": "She did not think herself a genius by any means; but when the writing\nfit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a\nblissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat\nsafe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real and\ndear to her as any in the flesh. Sleep forsook her eyes, meals stood\nuntasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which\nblessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth living, even\nif they bore no other fruit. The divine afflatus usually lasted a week\nor two, and then she emerged from her \"vortex,\" hungry, sleepy, cross,\nor despondent.She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed\nupon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for her virtue\nwas rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's Course, the lecture on\nthe Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for\nsuch an audience, but took it for granted that some great social evil\nwould be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories\nof the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price\nof coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder\nriddles than that of the Sphinx.They were early; and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, Jo\namused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the\nseat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads,\nand bonnets to match, discussing Woman's Rights and making tatting.\nBeyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the\nhand, a sombre spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an\nold gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On\nher right, her only neighbor was a studious-looking lad absorbed in a\nnewspaper.It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,\nidly wondering what unfortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed\nthe melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume, tumbling\nover a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young\ngentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each\nother close by, and a dishevelled female was flying away in the\nbackground with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw\nher looking, and, with boyish good-nature, offered half his paper,\nsaying bluntly, \"Want to read it? That's a first-rate story.\""

  "content": "Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for\nlads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,\nmystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light\nliterature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's\ninvention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the\n_dramatis personæ_, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.\"Prime, isn't it?\" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last\nparagraph of her portion.\"I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,\" returned Jo,\namused at his admiration of the trash.\"I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good\nliving out of such stories, they say;\" and he pointed to the name of\nMrs. S. L. A. N. G. Northbury, under the title of the tale.\"Do you know her?\" asked Jo, with sudden interest.\"No; but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the\noffice where this paper is printed.\"\"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?\" and Jo\nlooked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly-sprinkled\nexclamation-points that adorned the page.\"Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well for\nwriting it.\"Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while Prof.\nSands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and\nhieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,\nand boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its\ncolumns for a sensational story. By the time the lecture ended and the\naudience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not the\nfirst founded upon paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her\nstory, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the\nelopement or after the murder."

  "content": "She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much to\nthe disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when\n\"genius took to burning.\" Jo had never tried this style before,\ncontenting herself with very mild romances for the \"Spread Eagle.\" Her\ntheatrical experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for\nthey gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language,\nand costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her\nlimited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to\nmake it, and, having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an\nearthquake, as a striking and appropriate _dénouement_. The manuscript\nwas privately despatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if\nthe tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect, she\nwould be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to\nkeep a secret; but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all\nhope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which\nalmost took her breath away; for on opening it, a check for a hundred\ndollars fell into her lap. For a minute she stared at it as if it had\nbeen a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry. If the amiable\ngentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense\nhappiness he was giving a fellow-creature, I think he would devote his\nleisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement; for Jo valued the\nletter more than the money, because it was encouraging; and after years\nof effort it was _so_ pleasant to find that she had learned to do\nsomething, though it was only to write a sensation story.[Illustration: A check for one hundred dollars]A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed\nherself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the\nletter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won\nthe prize. Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story came\nevery one read and praised it; though after her father had told her that\nthe language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the tragedy\nquite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly way,--\"You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never mind the\nmoney.\"\"_I_ think the money is the best part of it. What _will_ you do with\nsuch a fortune?\" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a\nreverential eye.\"Send Beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two,\" answered Jo\npromptly.\"Oh, how splendid! No, I can't do it, dear, it would be so selfish,\"\ncried Beth, who had clapped her thin hands, and taken a long breath, as\nif pining for fresh ocean-breezes; then stopped herself, and motioned\naway the check which her sister waved before her."

I never get on when I think of myself alone,\nso it will help me to work for you, don't you see? Besides, Marmee needs\nthe change, and she won't leave you, so you _must_ go. Won't it be fun\nto see you come home plump and rosy again? Hurrah for Dr. Jo, who always\ncures her patients!\"To the sea side they went, after much discussion; and though Beth didn't\ncome home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,\nwhile Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger; so Jo was\nsatisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with\na cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She\ndid earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the\nhouse; for by the magic of a pen, her \"rubbish\" turned into comforts for\nthem all. \"The Duke's Daughter\" paid the butcher's bill, \"A Phantom\nHand\" put down a new carpet, and the \"Curse of the Coventrys\" proved the\nblessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny\nside, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction\nwhich comes from hearty work of head or hand; and to the inspiration of\nnecessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the\nworld. Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and ceased to envy\nricher girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could\nsupply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market; and,\nencouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and\nfortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to all her\nconfidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling to three\npublishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she would cut\nit down one third, and omit all the parts which she particularly\nadmired.\"Now I must either bundle it back into my tin-kitchen to mould, pay for\nprinting it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers, and get what I can\nfor it.

Make a good,\npopular book, and get as much money as you can. By and by, when, you've\ngot a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical and\nmetaphysical people in your novels,\" said Amy, who took a strictly\npractical view of the subject.\"Well,\" said Jo, laughing, \"if my people _are_ 'philosophical and\nmetaphysical,' it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,\nexcept what I hear father say, sometimes.

In the hope of\npleasing every one, she took every one's advice; and, like the old man\nand his donkey in the fable, suited nobody.Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got\ninto it; so that was allowed to remain, though she had her doubts about\nit. Her mother thought that there _was_ a trifle too much description;\nout, therefore, it nearly all came, and with it many necessary links in\nthe story. Meg admired the tragedy; so Jo piled up the agony to suit\nher, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in\nlife, Jo quenched the sprightly scenes which relieved the sombre\ncharacter of the story. Then, to complete the ruin, she cut it down one\nthird, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked\nrobin, out into the big, busy world, to try its fate.Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it; likewise\nplenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she expected that\nshe was thrown into a state of bewilderment, from which it took her some\ntime to recover."

She brought so much\nlove, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but\nsucceed, in spite of some obstacles. Her paradise was not a tranquil\none; for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and\nbustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares. She was too\ntired, sometimes, even to smile; John grew dyspeptic after a course of\ndainty dishes, and ungratefully demanded plain fare. As for buttons, she\nsoon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the\ncarelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,\nand then see if _his_ work would stand impatient tugs and clumsy fingers\nany better than hers."

John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though she\nbeamed at him from behind the familiar coffee-pot; nor did Meg miss any\nof the romance from the daily parting, when her husband followed up his\nkiss with the tender inquiry, \"Shall I send home veal or mutton for\ndinner, darling?\" The little house ceased to be a glorified bower, but\nit became a home, and the young couple soon felt that it was a change\nfor the better. At first they played keep-house, and frolicked over it\nlike children; then John took steadily to business, feeling the cares of\nthe head of a family upon his shoulders; and Meg laid by her cambric\nwrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to work, as before said, with\nmore energy than discretion.While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's Receipt\nBook as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the problems\nwith patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited in to help eat\nup a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be privately\ndespatched with a batch of failures, which were to be concealed from all\neyes in the convenient stomachs of the little Hummels. An evening with\nJohn over the account-books usually produced a temporary lull in the\nculinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor\nman was put through a course of bread-pudding, hash, and warmed-over\ncoffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy\nfortitude. Before the golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her\ndomestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without,--a\nfamily jar."

  "content": "Fired with a housewifely wish to see her store-room stocked with\nhome-made preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John\nwas requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots, and an extra\nquantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe, and were to be\nattended to at once. As John firmly believed that \"my wife\" was equal to\nanything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that she\nshould be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most\npleasing form for winter use. Home came four dozen delightful little\npots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for\nher. With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the\nelbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the\nbib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her\nsuccess; for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array\nof pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and\nthe nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg\nresolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,\nstraining, and fussing over her jelly. She did her best; she asked\nadvice of Mrs. Cornelius; she racked her brain to remember what Hannah\ndid that she had left undone; she reboiled, resugared, and restrained,\nbut that dreadful stuff wouldn't \"_jell_.\"She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask mother to lend a hand, but\nJohn and she had agreed that they would never annoy any one with their\nprivate worries, experiments, or quarrels. They had laughed over that\nlast word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one; but\nthey had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on without\nhelp they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had advised the\nplan. So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot\nsummer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her topsy-turvy kitchen,\nwrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept.Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said,--\"My husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he\nlikes. I shall always be prepared; there shall be no flurry, no\nscolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good\ndinner. John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you please,\nand be sure of a welcome from me.\"How charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride to hear\nher say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior\nwife. But, although they had had company from time to time, it never\nhappened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an opportunity to\ndistinguish herself till now. It always happens so in this vale of\ntears; there is an inevitability about such things which we can only\nwonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can."

Congratulating himself that\na handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling sure that it\nwould be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant anticipations of\nthe charming effect it would produce, when his pretty wife came running\nout to meet him, he escorted his friend to his mansion, with the\nirrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband.It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached the\nDove-cote. The front door usually stood hospitably open; now it was not\nonly shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned the steps. The\nparlor-windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty wife\nsewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in her\nhair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her\nguest. Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared, but a\nsanguinary-looking boy asleep under the currant-bushes.\"I'm afraid something has happened. Step into the garden, Scott, while I\nlook up Mrs. Brooke,\" said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burnt sugar, and\nMr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face. He paused\ndiscreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared; but he could both see\nand hear, and, being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair; one edition of jelly was\ntrickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was\nburning gayly on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly\neating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly\nliquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat\nsobbing dismally.\"My dearest girl, what is the matter?\" cried John, rushing in, with\nawful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret\nconsternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.\"O John, I _am_ so tired and hot and cross and worried! I've been at it\ntill I'm all worn out. Do come and help me or I _shall_ die!\" and the\nexhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet\nwelcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized\nat the same time as the floor.\"What worries you, dear? Has anything dreadful happened?\" asked the\nanxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was\nall askew."

Don't cry, I can bear anything better than that.\nOut with it, love.\"\"The--the jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!\"John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward; and the\nderisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which\nput the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.\"Is that all? Fling it out of window, and don't bother any more about\nit. I'll buy you quarts if you want it; but for heaven's sake don't have\nhysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner, and--\"John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a\ntragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of mingled\nindignation, reproach, and dismay,--\"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how _could_ you\ndo such a thing?\"\"Hush, he's in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can't\nbe helped now,\" said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.\"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to\nhave remembered how busy I was,\" continued Meg petulantly; for even\nturtle-doves will peck when ruffled.\"I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for\nI met him on the way out. I never thought of asking leave, when you have\nalways told me to do as I liked. I never tried it before, and hang me if\nI ever do again!\" added John, with an aggrieved air.\"I should hope not! Take him away at once; I can't see him, and there\nisn't any dinner.\"\"Well, I like that! Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and the\npudding you promised?\" cried John, rushing to the larder.\"I hadn't time to cook anything; I meant to dine at mother's. I'm sorry,\nbut I was _so_ busy;\" and Meg's tears began again."

He restrained himself, however, and the little squall would have\nblown over, but for one unlucky word.\"It's a scrape, I acknowledge; but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull\nthrough, and have a good time yet. Don't cry, dear, but just exert\nyourself a bit, and knock us up something to eat. We're both as hungry\nas hunters, so we sha'n't mind what it is. Give us the cold meat, and\nbread and cheese; we won't ask for jelly.\"He meant it for a good-natured joke; but that one word sealed his fate.\nMeg thought it was _too_ cruel to hint about her sad failure, and the\nlast atom of patience vanished as he spoke.\"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can; I'm too used up to\n'exert' myself for any one. It's like a man to propose a bone and vulgar\nbread and cheese for company. I won't have anything of the sort in my\nhouse. Take that Scott up to mother's, and tell him I'm away, sick,\ndead,--anything. I won't see him, and you two can laugh at me and my\njelly as much as you like: you won't have anything else here;\" and\nhaving delivered her defiance all in one breath, Meg cast away her\npinafore, and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own\nroom.What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew; but Mr.\nScott was not taken \"up to mother's,\" and when Meg descended, after they\nhad strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous lunch\nwhich filled her with horror. Lotty reported that they had eaten \"a\nmuch, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the\nsweet stuff, and hide the pots.\"Meg longed to go and tell mother; but a sense of shame at her own\nshort-comings, of loyalty to John, \"who might be cruel, but nobody\nshould know it,\" restrained her; and after a summary clearing up, she\ndressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be\nforgiven."

He\nhad carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little wife as\nwell as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his friend\nenjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again. But John was\nangry, though he did not show it; he felt that Meg had got him into a\nscrape, and then deserted him in his hour of need. \"It wasn't fair to\ntell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when\nhe took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in\nthe lurch, to be laughed at or pitied. No, by George, it wasn't! and Meg\nmust know it.\" He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the\nflurry was over, and he strolled home, after seeing Scott off, a milder\nmood came over him. \"Poor little thing! it was hard upon her when she\ntried so heartily to please me. She was wrong, of course, but then she\nwas young. I must be patient and teach her.\" He hoped she had not gone\nhome--he hated gossip and interference. For a minute he was ruffled\nagain at the mere thought of it; and then the fear that Meg would cry\nherself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,\nresolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where\nshe had failed in her duty to her spouse.Meg likewise resolved to be \"calm and kind, but firm,\" and show _him_\nhis duty. She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed\nand comforted, as she was sure of being; but, of course, she did nothing\nof the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,\nas she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe; but, feeling\nthat his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came\nleisurely in, and laid himself upon the sofa, with the singularly\nrelevant remark,--\"We are going to have a new moon, my dear.\"\"I've no objection,\" was Meg's equally soothing remark.A few other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke,\nand wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished. John went\nto one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,\nfiguratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if new\nrosettes for her slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither\nspoke; both looked quite \"calm and firm,\" and both felt desperately\nuncomfortable.[Illustration: Both felt desperately uncomfortable]\"Oh dear,\" thought Meg, \"married life is very trying, and does need\ninfinite patience, as well as love, as mother says.\" The word \"mother\"\nsuggested other maternal counsels, given long ago, and received with\nunbelieving protests."

He is very decided, but never\nwill be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. He is\nvery accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait, though you\ncall him 'fussy.' Never deceive him by look or word, Meg, and he will\ngive you the confidence you deserve, the support you need. He has a\ntemper, not like ours,--one flash, and then all over,--but the white,\nstill anger, that is seldom stirred, but once kindled, is hard to\nquench. Be careful, very careful, not to wake this anger against\nyourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. Watch\nyourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against\nthe little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave\nthe way for bitter sorrow and regret.\"These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,\nespecially the last. This was the first serious disagreement; her own\nhasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her\nown anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to\nsuch a scene quite melted her heart. She glanced at him with tears in\nher eyes, but he did not see them; she put down her work and got up,\nthinking, \"I _will_ be the first to say, 'Forgive me,'\" but he did not\nseem to hear her; she went very slowly across the room, for pride was\nhard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head. For a\nminute she felt as if she really couldn't do it; then came the thought,\n\"This is the beginning, I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach\nmyself with,\" and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the\nforehead. Of course that settled it; the penitent kiss was better than a\nworld of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying\ntenderly,--\"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly-pots. Forgive me,\ndear, I never will again!\"But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both\ndeclaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made; for family\npeace was preserved in that little family jar.After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and\nserved him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first\ncourse; on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made\neverything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a happy\nfellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the\nway home."

Sallie Moffat\nrenewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at\nthe little house, or inviting \"that poor dear\" to come in and spend the\nday at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often\nfelt lonely; all were busy at home, John absent till night, and nothing\nto do but sew, or read, or potter about. So it naturally fell out that\nMeg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend. Seeing\nSallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself because\nshe had not got them. Sallie was very kind, and often offered her the\ncoveted trifles; but Meg declined them, knowing that John wouldn't like\nit; and then this foolish little woman went and did what John disliked\ninfinitely worse.She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted\nher, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value\nmore,--his money. She knew where it was, was free to take what she\nliked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny,\npay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's wife.\nTill now, she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her little\naccount-books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without fear. But\nthat autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted her, like\nmany a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress. Meg didn't like to\nbe pitied and made to feel poor; it irritated her, but she was ashamed\nto confess it, and now and then she tried to console herself by buying\nsomething pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she had to economize. She\nalways felt wicked after it, for the pretty things were seldom\nnecessaries; but then they cost so little, it wasn't worth worrying\nabout; so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in the shopping\nexcursions she was no longer a passive looker-on."
