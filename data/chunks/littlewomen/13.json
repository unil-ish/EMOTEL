The young lady herself received the\nnews as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture,\nand began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving\nsuch trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in\nvisions of art than herself.\"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,\" she said impressively, as\nshe scraped her best palette. \"It will decide my career; for if I have\nany genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove\nit.\"\"Suppose you haven't?\" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new\ncollars which were to be handed over to Amy.\"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,\" replied the\naspirant for fame, with philosophic composure; but she made a wry face\nat the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on\nvigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.\"No, you won't; you hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man, and\ncome home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days,\" said Jo.\"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one\nwill. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I\nshould like to be able to help those who are,\" said Amy, smiling, as if\nthe part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor\ndrawing-teacher.\"Hum!\" said Jo, with a sigh; \"if you wish it you'll have it, for your\nwishes are always granted--mine never.\"\"Would you like to go?\" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with\nher knife.\"Rather!\"\"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum\nfor relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times.\"\"Thank you; I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes,\nif it ever does,\" returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer\nas gratefully as she could."

Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue\nribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried\ntill she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the\nsteamer sailed; then, just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it\nsuddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her\nand those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last\nlingerer, saying with a sob,--\"Oh, take care of them for me; and if anything should happen--\"\"I will, dear, I will; and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort\nyou,\" whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to\nkeep his word.So Amy sailed away to find the old world, which is always new and\nbeautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from\nthe shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall\nthe happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see\nnothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Flo and I ordered a hansom-cab]XXXI.OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.\"LONDON.\n    \"DEAREST PEOPLE,--\"Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,\n    Piccadilly. It's not a fashionable place, but uncle stopped here\n    years ago, and won't go anywhere else; however, we don't mean to\n    stay long, so it's no great matter. Oh, I can't begin to tell\n    you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so I'll only give you bits\n    out of my note-book, for I've done nothing but sketch and\n    scribble since I started.\"I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but\n    after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day,\n    with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Every one was very\n    kind to me, especially the officers. Don't laugh, Jo; gentlemen\n    really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait\n    upon one; and as they have nothing to do, it's a mercy to make\n    them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death, I'm\n    afraid.[Illustration: \"Every one was very kind, especially the\n                         officers.\"--Page 378.]"

Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid\n    air and waves! It was almost as exciting as riding a fast\n    horse, when we went rushing on so grandly. I wish Beth could\n    have come, it would have done her so much good; as for Jo, she\n    would have gone up and sat on the main-top jib, or whatever the\n    high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and\n    tooted on the captain's speaking-trumpet, she'd have been in\n    such a state of rapture.\"It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and\n    found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here\n    and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's\n    country-seats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It\n    was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to see\n    it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore _so_\n    picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it.\"At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us,--Mr.\n    Lennox,--and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney,\n    he sighed and sung, with a look at me,--'Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?\n         She lives on the banks of Killarney;\n         From the glance of her eye,\n         Shun danger and fly,\n         For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney.'Wasn't that nonsensical?\"We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It's a dirty, noisy\n    place, and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out and bought a\n    pair of dog-skin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an\n    umbrella, and got shaved _à la_ mutton-chop, the first thing.\n    Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton; but\n    the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the little\n    bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said, with a\n    grin, 'There yer har, sir. I've give 'em the latest Yankee\n    shine.' It amused uncle immensely. Oh, I _must_ tell you what\n    that absurd Lennox did! He got his friend Ward, who came on with\n    us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my\n    room was a lovely one, with 'Robert Lennox's compliments,' on\n    the card. Wasn't that fun, girls? I like travelling."

The farmhouses were my delight; with thatched roofs,\n    ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy\n    children at the doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than\n    ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a\n    contented cluck, as if they never got nervous, like Yankee\n    biddies. Such perfect color I never saw,--the grass so green,\n    sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark,--I was in a rapture\n    all the way. So was Flo; and we kept bouncing from one side to\n    the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along\n    at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Aunt was tired and went to\n    sleep, but uncle read his guide-book, and wouldn't be astonished\n    at anything. This is the way we went on: Amy, flying up,--'Oh,\n    that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!' Flo,\n    darting to my window,--'How sweet! We must go there some time,\n    won't we, papa?' Uncle, calmly admiring his boots,--'No, my\n    dear, not unless you want beer; that's a brewery.'\"A pause,--then Flo cried out, 'Bless me, there's a gallows and\n    a man going up.' 'Where, where?' shrieks Amy, staring out at two\n    tall posts with a cross-beam and some dangling chains. 'A\n    colliery,' remarks uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. 'Here's a\n    lovely flock of lambs all lying down,' says Amy. 'See, papa,\n    aren't they pretty!' added Flo sentimentally. 'Geese, young\n    ladies,' returns uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo\n    settles down to enjoy 'The Flirtations of Capt. Cavendish,' and\n    I have the scenery all to myself.\"Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was\n    nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested, unpacked,\n    and shopped a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some\n    new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready.\n    A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the\n    loveliest mantle you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is\n    perfectly splendid; things seem so cheap--nice ribbons only\n    sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in\n    Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?\"Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while aunt\n    and uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned\n    afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in\n    them alone. It was so droll! for when we were shut in by the\n    wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and\n    told me to stop him. But he was up outside behind somewhere, and\n    I couldn't get at him. He didn't hear me call, nor see me flap\n    my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling\n    away, and whirling around corners at a break-neck pace. At last,\n    in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on poking it\n    open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said,--\"'Now then, mum?'"

I poked again, and said, 'A little\n    faster;' then off he went, helter-skelter, as before, and we\n    resigned ourselves to our fate.\"To-day was fair and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are\n    more aristocratic than we look. The Duke of Devonshire lives\n    near. I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate; and the\n    Duke of Wellington's house is not far off. Such sights as I saw,\n    my dear! It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers\n    rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous\n    Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and\n    powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with the rosiest\n    children I ever saw; handsome girls, looking half asleep;\n    dandies, in queer English hats and lavender kids, lounging\n    about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps\n    stuck on one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch them.\"Rotten Row means '_Route de Roi_,' or the king's way; but now\n    it's more like a riding-school than anything else. The horses\n    are splendid, and the men, especially the grooms, ride well; but\n    the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn't according to our\n    rules. I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they\n    trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant habits and high\n    hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah's Ark. Every one\n    rides,--old men, stout ladies, little children,--and the young\n    folks do a deal of flirting here; I saw a pair exchange\n    rosebuds, for it's the thing to wear one in the button-hole, and\n    I thought it rather a nice little idea.\"In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey; but don't expect me to\n    describe it, that's impossible--so I'll only say it was sublime!\n    This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an\n    appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.\"MIDNIGHT."

Both are tall fellows, with whiskers;\n    Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better, for\n    he only limps slightly, and uses no crutches. They had heard\n    from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their\n    house; but uncle won't go, so we shall return the call, and see\n    them as we can.

The\n    day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular English\n    picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I\n    could copy; also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up. We\n    'did' London to our hearts' content, thanks to Fred and Frank,\n    and were sorry to go away; for, though English people are slow\n    to take you in, when they once make up their minds to do it they\n    cannot be outdone in hospitality, _I_ think.

Uncle doesn't know ten words, and\n    insists on talking English very loud, as if that would make\n    people understand him.

Rainy\n    days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures. Jo would turn\n    up her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no\n    soul for art; but _I_ have, and I'm cultivating eye and taste as\n    fast as I can.

Little Nap. is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his\n    tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his\n    four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets, and a\n    mounted guard before and behind.[Illustration: I've seen the imperial family several times]\"We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely,\n    though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better.

Get father's old guide-books, and read\n    about it; I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At\n    Coblentz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with\n    whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was\n    a moonlight night, and, about one o'clock, Flo and I were waked\n    by the most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and\n    hid behind the curtains; but sly peeps showed us Fred and the\n    students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing\n    I ever saw,--the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress\n    opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of\n    stone.\"When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them\n    scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and\n    go laughing away,--to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next\n    morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his\n    vest-pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and\n    said I didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him,\n    for he tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again.\n    I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to\n    look like it."

He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite\n    fond of him; I never thought of anything but a travelling\n    friendship, till the serenade night. Since then I've begun to\n    feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily\n    adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven't\n    flirted, mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and\n    have done my very best. I can't help it if people like me; I\n    don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for\n    them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know mother\n    will shake her head, and the girls say, 'Oh, the mercenary\n    little wretch!' but I've made up my mind, and, if Fred asks me,\n    I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him,\n    and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young,\n    clever enough, and very rich,--ever so much richer than the\n    Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I should\n    be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous\n    people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have\n    the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one as it is! A city\n    house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses,\n    but twice as comfortable, and full of solid luxury, such as\n    English people believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've\n    seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and\n    pictures of the country place, with its park, great house,\n    lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should\n    ask! and I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up\n    so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I\n    hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I\n    can help. One of us _must_ marry well; Meg didn't, Jo won't,\n    Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything cosey all round.\n    I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of\n    that; and, though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well,\n    and, in time, I should get fond enough of him if he was very\n    fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I've been turning\n    the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible\n    to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little\n    things showed it; he never goes with Flo, always gets on my side\n    of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we\n    are alone, and frowns at any one else who ventures to speak to\n    me. Yesterday, at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us,\n    and then said something to his friend,--a rakish-looking\n    baron,--about '_ein wonderschönes Blöndchen_,' Fred looked as\n    fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely, it nearly flew\n    off his plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but\n    is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might\n    guess from his bonnie blue eyes."

We had a charming time poking\n    about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the\n    beautiful gardens made by the elector, long ago, for his English\n    wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine;\n    so, while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there\n    trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with\n    scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got\n    into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar rolling\n    through the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band\n    below, and waiting for my lover, like a real story-book girl. I\n    had a feeling that something was going to happen, and I was\n    ready for it. I didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool,\n    and only a little excited.[Illustration: Trying to sketch the gray-stone lion's head on the wall]\"By and by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying\n    through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled that I\n    forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said\n    he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was\n    very ill; so he was going at once, in the night train, and only\n    had time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and\n    disappointed for myself, but only for a minute, because he\n    said, as he shook hands,--and said it in a way that I could not\n    mistake,--'I shall soon come back; you won't forget me, Amy?'"

I never force my children's\nconfidence, and I seldom have to wait for it long.\"Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed\nquite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's; and, after\nsewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said,--\"I think she is growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have\nhopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why, or being able to\nexplain them.

A slight incident gave Jo the clue\nto the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the\nrest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she\nand Beth were alone together; yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on\nher sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth's\nwork often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand,\nin a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal\nlandscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic\nblackbird, and a voice called out,--[Illustration: She leaned her head upon her hands]\"All serene! Coming in to-night.\"Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by\ntill his quick tramp died away, then said softly, as if to herself,--\"How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.\""

Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring\nsomething about needing more paper.\"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!\" she said, sitting down in her own\nroom, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had\njust made. \"I never dreamt of such a thing. What _will_ mother say? I\nwonder if he--\" there Jo stopped, and turned scarlet with a sudden\nthought. \"If he shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be. He\nmust; I'll make him!\" and she shook her head threateningly at the\npicture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.\n\"Oh dear, we _are_ growing up with a vengeance.

  "content": "Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie, from which she did not wake\ntill the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which\nonly confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked\nwith Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle,\nbut so was everybody's; therefore, no one thought of imagining that he\ncared more for her than for the others. Indeed, a general impression had\nprevailed in the family, of late, that \"our boy\" was getting fonder than\never of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject, and\nscolded violently if any one dared to suggest it. If they had known the\nvarious tender passages of the past year, or rather attempts at tender\npassages which had been nipped in the bud, they would have had the\nimmense satisfaction of saying, \"I told you so.\" But Jo hated\n\"philandering,\" and wouldn't allow it, always having a joke or a smile\nready at the least sign of impending danger.When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month;\nbut these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much\namused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope, despair,\nand resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly\nconferences. But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many\nshrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged\noccasionally in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender\nsubject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,\nand gave out that he was going to \"dig,\" intending to graduate in a\nblaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight\nconfidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the\neye; for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred\nimaginary heroes to real ones, because, when tired of them, the former\ncould be shut up in the tin-kitchen till called for, and the latter were\nless manageable."

If she had not\ngot the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in\nthe fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But\nhaving given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at\na great pace; and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course\nof romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual, Beth lay on\nthe sofa, and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all\nsorts of gossip; for she depended on her weekly \"spin,\" and he never\ndisappointed her. But that evening, Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested\non the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she\nlistened with intense interest to an account of some exciting\ncricket-match, though the phrases, \"caught off a tice,\" \"stumped off his\nground,\" and \"the leg hit for three,\" were as intelligible to her as\nSanscrit. She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it, that\nshe saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that he\ndropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a little\nabsent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an assiduity\nthat was really almost tender.\"Who knows? stranger things have happened,\" thought Jo, as she fussed\nabout the room. \"She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make\nlife delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love each\nother. I don't see how he can help it; and I do believe he would if the\nrest of us were out of the way.\"As every one _was_ out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that\nshe ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should she go?\nand burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she sat\ndown to settle that point.Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa,--long, broad,\nwell-cushioned, and low; a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the\ngirls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back, rode\non the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested tired\nheads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young women.\nThey all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always\nbeen Jo's favorite lounging-place. Among the many pillows that adorned\nthe venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly\nhorsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end; this\nrepulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon of\ndefence, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber."

If \"the\nsausage\" as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might\napproach and repose; but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to the man,\nwoman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot to\nbarricade her corner, and had not been in her seat five minutes, before\na massive form appeared beside her, and, with both arms spread over the\nsofa-back, both long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed,\nwith a sigh of satisfaction,--\"Now, _this_ is filling at the price.\"[Illustration: Now, this is filling at the price]\"No slang,\" snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.

She's engaged.

Jo knew that \"young Laurence\" was regarded as a\nmost eligible _parti_ by worldly mammas, was much smiled upon by their\ndaughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb\nof him; so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be spoilt,\nand rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in\nmodest girls.
