  "content": "\"P. S. On reading over my letter it strikes me as rather Bhaery;\n    but I am always interested in odd people, and I really had\n    nothing else to write about. Bless you!\"\"DECEMBER.\"MY PRECIOUS BETSEY,--\"As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to\n    you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings\n    on; for, though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh,\n    be joyful! After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the\n    way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to\n    shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not\n    so interesting to me as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by\n    them, and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little\n    lads, quite after my own heart; for the mixture of German and\n    American spirit in them produces a constant state of\n    effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether\n    spent in the house or out; for on pleasant days they all go to\n    walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep\n    order; and then such fun!\"We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take lessons. I\n    really couldn't help it, and it all came about in such a droll\n    way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke\n    called to me, one day, as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room, where she\n    was rummaging.\"'Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come and help me\n    put these books to rights, for I've turned everything upside\n    down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new\n    handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago.'"

Books and papers everywhere; a broken\n    meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantel-piece as if done\n    with; a ragged bird, without any tail, chirped on one\n    window-seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other;\n    half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the\n    manuscripts; dirty little boots stood drying before the fire;\n    and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave\n    of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand\n    rummage three of the missing articles were found,--one over the\n    bird-cage, one covered with ink, and a third burnt brown, having\n    been used as a holder.\"'Such a man!' laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the\n    relics in the rag-bag. 'I suppose the others are torn up to rig\n    ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite-tails. It's dreadful,\n    but I can't scold him: he's so absent-minded and good-natured,\n    he lets those boys ride over him rough-shod. I agreed to do his\n    washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I\n    forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.'\"'Let me mend them,' said I. 'I don't mind it, and he needn't\n    know. I'd like to,--he's so kind to me about bringing my letters\n    and lending books.'\"So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two\n    pairs of the socks,--for they were boggled out of shape with his\n    queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it\n    out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the\n    lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much\n    that I took a fancy to learn; for Tina runs in and out, leaving\n    the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this\n    door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what\n    he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had\n    gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was\n    busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most\n    absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was\n    Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to\n    Tina not to betray him.\"'So!' he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, 'you peep\n    at me, I peep at you, and that is not bad; but see, I am not\n    pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?'\"'Yes; but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,' I\n    blundered out, as red as a peony."

'Yes, they say to one another, these\n    so kind ladies, \"he is a stupid old fellow; he will see not what\n    we do; he will never opserve that his sock-heels go not in holes\n    any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall,\n    and believe that strings make theirselves.\" Ah! but I haf an\n    eye, and I see much.

I\n    took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog.\n    The Professor was very patient with me, but it must have been\n    torment to him, and now and then he'd look at me with such an\n    expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up with me whether\n    to laugh or cry. I tried both ways; and when it came to a sniff\n    of utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to\n    the floor, and marched out of the room. I felt myself disgraced\n    and deserted forever, but didn't blame him a particle, and was\n    scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and\n    shake myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if\n    I'd covered myself with glory.\"'Now we shall try a new way.

I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away\n    (no other word will express it) with all my might, tumbling over\n    long words, pronouncing according to the inspiration of the\n    minute, and doing my very best. When I finished reading my first\n    page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and cried\n    out, in his hearty way, 'Das ist gute! Now we go well! My turn.\n    I do him in German; gif me your ear.' And away he went, rumbling\n    out the words with his strong voice, and a relish which was good\n    to see as well as hear. Fortunately the story was the 'Constant\n    Tin Soldier,' which is droll, you know, so I could laugh,--and I\n    did,--though I didn't understand half he read, for I couldn't\n    help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so\n    comical.\"After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty\n    well; for this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the\n    grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills\n    in jelly.

I can't\n    tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn't\n    get it till night, and had given up hoping. Your letter came in\n    the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it\n    for a surprise; so I was disappointed, for I'd had a 'kind of a\n    feeling' that you wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my\n    mind, as I sat up in my room, after tea; and when the big,\n    muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged\n    it, and pranced. It was so _homey_ and refreshing, that I sat\n    down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and\n    cried, in my usual absurd way. The things were just what I\n    wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought.\n    Beth's new 'ink-bib' was capital; and Hannah's box of hard\n    gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll be sure and wear the nice\n    flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books father\n    has marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps!"

Poor as he is, he\n    didn't forget a servant or a child in the house; and not a soul\n    here, from the French laundry-woman to Miss Norton, forgot him.\n    I was so glad of that.\"They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's Eve. I\n    didn't mean to go down, having no dress; but at the last minute,\n    Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me\n    lace and feathers; so I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed\n    in with a mask on. No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and\n    no one dreamed of the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think\n    I am very stiff and cool, most of them; and so I am to\n    whipper-snappers) could dance and dress, and burst out into a\n    'nice derangement of epitaphs, like an allegory on the banks of\n    the Nile.' I enjoyed it very much; and when we unmasked, it was\n    fun to see them stare at me. I heard one of the young men tell\n    another that he knew I'd been an actress; in fact, he thought he\n    remembered seeing me at one of the minor theatres. Meg will\n    relish that joke. Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was\n    Titania,--a perfect little fairy in his arms. To see them dance\n    was 'quite a landscape,' to use a Teddyism.\"I had a very happy New Year, after all; and when I thought it\n    over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite\n    of my many failures; for I'm cheerful all the time now, work\n    with a will, and take more interest in other people than I used\n    to, which is satisfactory.

But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for\npublic opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on\nbigger bean-stalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed\nawhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble, and the\nleast lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly. But the\n\"up again and take another\" spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack; so\nshe scrambled up, on the shady side this time, and got more booty, but\nnearly left behind her what was far more precious than the money-bags.She took to writing sensation stories; for in those dark ages, even\nall-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but concocted a\n\"thrilling tale,\" and boldly carried it herself to Mr. Dashwood, editor\nof the \"Weekly Volcano.\" She had never read \"Sartor Resartus,\" but she\nhad a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful\nover many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she\ndressed herself in her best, and, trying to persuade herself that she\nwas neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and\ndirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of\ncigar-smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their\nheels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of\nthem took the trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by\nthis reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much\nembarrassment,--\"Excuse me, I was looking for the 'Weekly Volcano' office; I wished to\nsee Mr. Dashwood.\""

Feeling\nthat she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her\nmanuscript, and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence,\nblundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the\noccasion.\"A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as an\nexperiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more if this\nsuits.\"While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript,\nand was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers, and\ncasting critical glances up and down the neat pages.\"Not a first attempt, I take it?\" observing that the pages were\nnumbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon,--sure\nsign of a novice.\"No, sir; she has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in the\n'Blarneystone Banner.'\"\"Oh, did she?\" and Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to\ntake note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the\nbuttons on her boots. \"Well, you can leave it, if you like. We've more\nof this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present;\nbut I'll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.\"Now, Jo did _not_ like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at\nall; but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but\nbow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was\napt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both; for it was\nperfectly evident, from the knowing glances exchanged among the\ngentlemen, that her little fiction of \"my friend\" was considered a good\njoke; and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as\nhe closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to\nreturn, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching\npinafores vigorously; and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh\nover the scene, and long for next week.When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced; Mr.\nDashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable; and Mr.\nDashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners:\nso the second interview was much more comfortable than the first."

Her readers were not particular about such trifles\nas grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously\npermitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it\nnecessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the\nfact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely\nleft him in the lurch.She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew\nstout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the mountains\nnext summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One thing\ndisturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at\nhome. She had a feeling that father and mother would not approve, and\npreferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon afterward. It was\neasy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories; Mr.\nDashwood had, of course, found it out very soon, but promised to be\ndumb; and, for a wonder, kept his word.She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write\nnothing of which she should be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of\nconscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her\nearnings and laugh over her well-kept secret."

Jo soon found that her\ninnocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world\nwhich underlies society; so, regarding it in a business light, she set\nabout supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to\nfind material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if\nnot masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents,\nincidents, and crimes; she excited the suspicions of public librarians\nby asking for works on poisons; she studied faces in the street, and\ncharacters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her; she delved in the\ndust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as\ngood as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin, and misery, as well\nas her limited opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering\nfinely; but, unconsciously, she was beginning to desecrate some of the\nwomanliest attributes of a woman's character. She was living in bad\nsociety; and, imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for\nshe was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and\nwas fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature\nacquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to\nall of us.She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of\nother people's passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating\nabout her own,--a morbid amusement, in which healthy young minds do not\nvoluntarily indulge. Wrong-doing always brings its own punishment; and,\nwhen Jo most needed hers, she got it.I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read\ncharacter, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest,\nbrave, and strong; but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every\nperfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who interested\nher in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one of their\nconversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and lovely\ncharacters, wherever she found them, as good training for a writer. Jo\ntook him at his word, for she coolly turned round and studied him,--a\nproceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for the\nworthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit."

He was neither\nrich nor great, young nor handsome; in no respect what is called\nfascinating, imposing, or brilliant; and yet he was as attractive as a\ngenial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about\na warm hearth. He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving something\naway; a stranger, yet every one was his friend; no longer young, but as\nhappy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face looked\nbeautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake.\nJo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and, at last,\ndecided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. If he had any\nsorrow, \"it sat with its head under its wing,\" and he turned only his\nsunny side to the world. There were lines upon his forehead, but Time\nseemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to\nothers. The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many\nfriendly words and cheery laughs; his eyes were never cold or hard, and\nhis big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than\nwords.His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the\nwearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him\ncomfortable; his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart\nunderneath; his rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets\nplainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full;\nhis very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy\nlike other people's.\"That's it!\" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that\ngenuine good-will towards one's fellow-men could beautify and dignify\neven a stout German teacher, who shovelled in his dinner, darned his own\nsocks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine\nrespect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the\nProfessor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,\nand no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much\nhonored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came\nto see him, and, in a conversation with Miss Norton, divulged the\npleasing fact. From her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better\nbecause Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She felt proud to know that he was\nan honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in\nAmerica; and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the\nspice of romance which this discovery gave it.Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most\nunexpected manner. Miss Norton had the _entrée_ into literary society,\nwhich Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her. The solitary\nwoman felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many\nfavors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor. She took them with\nher, one night, to a select symposium, held in honor of several\ncelebrities.[Illustration: A select symposium]"

The great novelist vibrated between two decanters\nwith the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with\none of the Madame de Staëls of the age, who looked daggers at another\nCorinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after out-manœuvring her in\nefforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly\nand appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech\nimpossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and\nglacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting themselves to\noysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician, who was\ncharming the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen\nof the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of\nthe party.Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely _désillusionée_,\nthat she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined\nher, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the\nphilosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an\nintellectual tournament in the recess. The conversation was miles beyond\nJo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were\nunknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms; and the\nonly thing \"evolved from her inner consciousness,\" was a bad headache\nafter it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually that the world was\nbeing picked to pieces, and put together on new, and, according to the\ntalkers, on infinitely better principles than before; that religion was\nin a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be\nthe only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any\nsort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came\nover her, as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time\nand space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him\nlooking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear.\nHe shook his head, and beckoned her to come away; but she was\nfascinated, just then, by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and\nkept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to\nrely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man, and slow to offer his own opinions,\nnot because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be\nlightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young people,\nattracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his\nbrows, and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul\nwould be led astray by the rockets, to find, when the display was over,\nthat they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand."

He had a hard fight, for\nthe wise men argued well; but he didn't know when he was beaten, and\nstood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he talked, the world got\nright again to Jo; the old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed\nbetter than the new; God was not a blind force, and immortality was not\na pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She felt as if she had solid ground\nunder her feet again; and when Mr. Bhaer paused, out-talked, but not one\nwhit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.She did neither; but she remembered this scene, and gave the Professor\nher heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out\nthen and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent. She\nbegan to see that character is a better possession than money, rank,\nintellect, or beauty; and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man\nhas defined it to be, \"truth, reverence, and good-will,\" then her friend\nFriedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.This belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she coveted his\nrespect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship; and, just when the\nwish was sincerest, she came near losing everything. It all grew out of\na cocked hat; for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her\nlesson, with a paper soldier-cap on his head, which Tina had put there,\nand he had forgotten to take off.\"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down,\" thought\nJo, with a smile, as he said \"Goot efening,\" and sat soberly down, quite\nunconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his\nhead-gear, for he was going to read her the \"Death of Wallenstein.\"[Illustration: He doesn't prink at his glass before coming]She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big,\nhearty laugh, when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover\nit for himself, and presently forgot all about it; for to hear a German\nread Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. After the reading came\nthe lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night,\nand the cocked-hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment. The Professor\ndidn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last, to ask, with an\nair of mild surprise that was irresistible,--\"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no\nrespect for me, that you go on so bad?\"\"How can I be respectful, sir, when you forget to take your hat off?\"\nsaid Jo."

I see him now; it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my cap.\nWell, it is nothing; but see you, if this lesson goes not well, you too\nshall wear him.\"But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes, because Mr. Bhaer\ncaught sight of a picture on the hat, and, unfolding it, said, with an\nair of great disgust,--\"I wish these papers did not come in the house; they are not for\nchildren to see, nor young people to read. It is not well, and I haf no\npatience with those who make this harm.\"Jo glanced at the sheet, and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a\nlunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like it; but the\nimpulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure, but fear,\nbecause, for a minute, she fancied the paper was the \"Volcano.\" It was\nnot, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that, even if it\nhad been, and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no name\nto betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush;\nfor, though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more than\npeople fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the\nnewspaper offices more than once; but as she never spoke of it, he asked\nno questions, in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it\noccurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it\ntroubled him. He did not say to himself, \"It is none of my business;\nI've no right to say anything,\" as many people would have done; he only\nremembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother's\nlove and father's care; and he was moved to help her with an impulse as\nquick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to\nsave a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his mind in a\nminute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face; and by the time the\npaper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready to say quite\nnaturally, but very gravely,--"

If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would\nnot feel that the living _was_ honest. They haf no right to put poison\nin the sugar-plum, and let the small ones eat it. No; they should think\na little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.\"Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in\nhis hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her; for her\ncheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke, and gone\nharmlessly up the chimney.\"I should like much to send all the rest after him,\" muttered the\nProfessor, coming back with a relieved air.Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her\nhard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute.\nThen she thought consolingly to herself, \"Mine are not like that; they\nare only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried;\" and taking up her\nbook, she said, with a studious face,--\"Shall we go on, sir? I'll be very good and proper now.\"\"I shall hope so,\" was all he said, but he meant more than she imagined;\nand the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words\n\"Weekly Volcano\" were printed in large type on her forehead."

Being a little short-sighted, Mr.\nBhaer sometimes used eye-glasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling to\nsee how they magnified the fine print of her book; now she seemed to\nhave got on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also; for the\nfaults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully, and filled her\nwith dismay.\"They _are_ trash, and will soon be worse than trash if I go on; for\neach is more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on, hurting\nmyself and other people, for the sake of money; I know it's so, for I\ncan't read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of\nit; and what _should_ I do if they were seen at home, or Mr. Bhaer got\nhold of them?\"Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her\nstove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.[Illustration: Jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove]\"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense; I'd better\nburn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up\nwith my gunpowder,\" she thought, as she watched the \"Demon of the Jura\"\nwhisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.But when nothing remained of all her three months' work except a heap of\nashes, and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the\nfloor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.\"I think I haven't done much harm _yet_, and may keep this to pay for my\ntime,\" she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, \"I almost\nwish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient. If I didn't care\nabout doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I\nshould get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that father and\nmother hadn't been so particular about such things.\"Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that \"father and mother\n_were_ particular,\" and pity from your heart those who have no such\nguardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like\nprison-walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations\nto build character upon in womanhood."

She had her doubts about it from the beginning; for her lively\nfancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she\nwould have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the\nlast century. She sent this didactic gem to several markets, but it\nfound no purchaser; and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood,\nthat morals didn't sell.Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of\nif she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it. The\nonly person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try\njuvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to\nconvert all the world to his particular belief. But much as she liked to\nwrite for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys\nas being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls, because they did not go\nto a particular Sabbath-school, nor all the good infants, who did go, as\nrewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to escorts of\nangels, when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their\nlisping tongues. So nothing came of these trials; and Jo corked up her\ninkstand, and said, in a fit of very wholesome humility,--\"I don't know anything; I'll wait till I do before I try again, and,\nmeantime, 'sweep mud in the street,' if I can't do better; that's\nhonest, at least;\" which decision proved that her second tumble down the\nbean-stalk had done her some good.While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had\nbeen as busy and uneventful as usual; and if she sometimes looked\nserious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. He did\nit so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would\naccept and profit by his reproof; but she stood the test, and he was\nsatisfied; for, though no words passed between them, he knew that she\nhad given up writing. Not only did he guess it by the fact that the\nsecond finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her\nevenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and\nstudied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on\noccupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant."

Every one seemed sorry when the time came; the children\nwere inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all over his\nhead, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.\"Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,\" he said,\nwhen she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard, in the corner,\nwhile she held a little levee on that last evening.She was going early, so she bade them all good-by over night; and when\nhis turn came, she said warmly,--\"Now, sir, you won't forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our\nway, will you? I'll never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to\nknow my friend.\"\"Do you?

Something in Mr. Bhaer's\nface suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a\n\"best friend,\" and, simply because she particularly wished not to look\nas if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush; and the\nmore she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina\non her knee, she didn't know what would have become of her. Fortunately,\nthe child was moved to hug her; so she managed to hide her face an\ninstant, hoping the Professor did not see it.
