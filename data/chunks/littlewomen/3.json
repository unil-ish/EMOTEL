So\nLaurie did his best, and sung delightfully, being in a particularly\nlively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\ncharacter. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening,\nsaid suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,--\"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?\"\"Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will\nmake a fine man, if not spoilt by petting,\" replied her mother.\"And he isn't conceited, is he?\" asked Amy.\"Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all like him so\nmuch.\"\"I see; it's nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant; but not to\nshow off, or get perked up,\" said Amy thoughtfully.\"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and\nconversation, if modestly used; but it is not necessary to display\nthem,\" said Mrs. March.\"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and\nribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them,\" added Jo; and the\nlecture ended in a laugh.[Illustration: Girls, where are you going?]VIII.JO MEETS APOLLYON.\"Girls, where are you going?\" asked Amy, coming into their room one\nSaturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out, with an\nair of secrecy which excited her curiosity.\"Never mind; little girls shouldn't ask questions,\" returned Jo sharply."

Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined\nto find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who\nnever refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \"Do tell me! I\nshould think you might let me go, too; for Beth is fussing over her\npiano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am _so_ lonely.\"\"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited,\" began Meg; but Jo broke in\nimpatiently, \"Now, Meg, be quiet, or you will spoil it all. You can't\ngo, Amy; so don't be a baby, and whine about it.\"\"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are; you were\nwhispering and laughing together, on the sofa, last night, and you\nstopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him?\"\"Yes, we are; now do be still, and stop bothering.\"Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her\npocket.\"I know! I know! you're going to the theatre to see the 'Seven\nCastles!'\" she cried; adding resolutely, \"and I _shall_ go, for mother\nsaid I might see it; and I've got my rag-money, and it was mean not to\ntell me in time.\"\"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,\" said Meg soothingly.\n\"Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well\nenough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you can go\nwith Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.\"\"I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let\nme; I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying for\nsome fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so good,\" pleaded Amy, looking as\npathetic as she could.\"Suppose we take her. I don't believe mother would mind, if we bundle\nher up well,\" began Meg.\"If _she_ goes _I_ sha'n't; and if I don't, Laurie won't like it; and it\nwill be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I\nshould think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't wanted,\" said Jo\ncrossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child,\nwhen she wanted to enjoy herself.Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,\nin her most aggravating way, \"I _shall_ go; Meg says I may; and if I pay\nfor myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it.\""

You sha'n't stir a step; so you may just stay where\nyou are,\" scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger\nin her hurry.Sitting on the floor, with one boot on, Amy began to cry, and Meg to\nreason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls\nhurried down, leaving their sister wailing; for now and then she forgot\nher grown-up ways, and acted like a spoilt child. Just as the party was\nsetting out, Amy called over the banisters, in a threatening tone,\n\"You'll be sorry for this, Jo March; see if you ain't.\"\"Fiddlesticks!\" returned Jo, slamming the door.They had a charming time, for \"The Seven Castles of the Diamond Lake\"\nwere as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish. But, in spite of\nthe comical red imps, sparkling elves, and gorgeous princes and\nprincesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it; the fairy\nqueen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy; and between the acts she\namused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her\n\"sorry for it.\" She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course\nof their lives, for both had quick tempers, and were apt to be violent\nwhen fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and\nsemi-occasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed\nafterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had\nhard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting\nher into trouble; her anger never lasted long, and, having humbly\nconfessed her fault, she sincerely repented, and tried to do better. Her\nsisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury,\nbecause she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be\ngood, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her;\nand it took years of patient effort to subdue it."

  "content": "When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an\ninjured air as they came in; never lifted her eyes from her book, or\nasked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered\nresentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire, and receive a glowing\ndescription of the play. On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's\nfirst look was toward the bureau; for, in their last quarrel, Amy had\nsoothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the\nfloor. Everything was in its place, however; and after a hasty glance\ninto her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had\nforgiven and forgotten her wrongs.There Jo was mistaken; for next day she made a discovery which produced\na tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the\nafternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited, and demanding\nbreathlessly, \"Has any one taken my book?\"Meg and Beth said \"No,\" at once, and looked surprised; Amy poked the\nfire, and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise, and was down upon her in\na minute.\"Amy, you've got it?\"\"No, I haven't.\"\"You know where it is, then?\"\"No, I don't.\"\"That's a fib!\" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking\nfierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.\"It isn't. I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't\ncare.\"\"You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll\nmake you,\" and Jo gave her a slight shake.\"Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book again,\"\ncried Amy, getting excited in her turn.\"Why not?\"\"I burnt it up.\"[Illustration: I burnt it up]\"What! my little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to\nfinish before father got home? Have you really burnt it?\" said Jo,\nturning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy\nnervously.\"Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross yesterday,\nand I have, so--\"Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy\ntill her teeth chattered in her head; crying, in a passion of grief and\nanger,--\"You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I'll never\nforgive you as long as I live.\"Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside\nherself; and, with a parting box on her sister's ear, she rushed out of\nthe room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone."

  "content": "The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard\nthe story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her\nsister. Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her\nfamily as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen\nlittle fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her\nwhole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to\nprint. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the\nold manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of\nseveral years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a\ndreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her.\nBeth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her\npet; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would\nlove her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted\nmore than any of them.When the tea-bell rung, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable\nthat it took all Amy's courage to say meekly,--\"Please forgive me, Jo; I'm very, very sorry.\"\"I never shall forgive you,\" was Jo's stern answer; and, from that\nmoment, she ignored Amy entirely.No one spoke of the great trouble,--not even Mrs. March,--for all had\nlearned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted;\nand the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own\ngenerous nature, softened Jo's resentment, and healed the breach. It was\nnot a happy evening; for, though they sewed as usual, while their mother\nread aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and\nthe sweet home-peace was disturbed. They felt this most when\nsinging-time came; for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone,\nand Amy broke down, so Meg and mother sung alone. But, in spite of their\nefforts to be as cheery as larks, the flute-like voices did not seem to\nchord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently,--\"My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger; forgive each other,\nhelp each other, and begin again to-morrow.\"Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief\nand anger all away; but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she felt so\ndeeply injured that she really _couldn't_ quite forgive yet. So she\nwinked hard, shook her head, and said, gruffly because Amy was\nlistening,--\"It was an abominable thing, and she don't deserve to be forgiven.\"With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential\ngossip that night."

Jo still looked like a thunder-cloud, and\nnothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning; she\ndropped her precious turn-over in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack\nof fidgets, Meg was pensive, Beth _would_ look grieved and wistful when\nshe got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always\ntalking about being good, and yet wouldn't try, when other people set\nthem a virtuous example.\"Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always\nkind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know,\" said Jo to herself,\nand off she went.Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient\nexclamation,--\"There! she promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we\nshall have. But it's no use to ask such a cross-patch to take me.\"\"Don't say that; you _were_ very naughty, and it _is_ hard to forgive\nthe loss of her precious little book; but I think she might do it now,\nand I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,\" said Meg. \"Go\nafter them; don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie,\nthen take a quiet minute, and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and\nI'm sure she'll be friends again, with all her heart.\"\"I'll try,\" said Amy, for the advice suited her; and, after a flurry to\nget ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over\nthe hill.It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached\nthem. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back; Laurie did not see, for he\nwas carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm\nspell had preceded the cold snap.\"I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right, before we\nbegin to race,\" Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young\nRussian, in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing her\nfingers, as she tried to put her skates on; but Jo never turned, and\nwent slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of\nsatisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till\nit grew strong, and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and\nfeelings always do, unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend,\nhe shouted back,--\"Keep near the shore; it isn't safe in the middle.\""

Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was\nharboring said in her ear,--\"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.\"Laurie had vanished round the bend; Jo was just at the turn, and Amy,\nfar behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the\nriver. For a minute Jo stood still, with a strange feeling at her heart;\nthen she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round,\njust in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with the sudden\ncrash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo's heart\nstand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone;\nshe tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in\nthem; and, for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring, with\na terror-stricken face, at the little blue hood above the black water.\nSomething rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out,--\"Bring a rail; quick, quick!\"How she did it, she never knew; but for the next few minutes she worked\nas if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,\nand, lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey till Jo dragged a\nrail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more\nfrightened than hurt.[Illustration: Held Amy up by his arms and hockey]\"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can; pile our things on\nher, while I get off these confounded skates,\" cried Laurie, wrapping\nhis coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps, which never seemed\nso intricate before.Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home; and, after an\nexciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets, before a hot\nfire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken; but flown about, looking\npale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands\ncut and bruised by ice and rails, and refractory buckles. When Amy was\ncomfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed,\nshe called Jo to her, and began to bind up the hurt hands."

Mother, if she _should_ die, it\nwould be my fault\"; and Jo dropped down beside the bed, in a passion of\npenitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her\nhardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the\nheavy punishment which might have come upon her.\"It's my dreadful temper! I try to cure it; I think I have, and then it\nbreaks out worse than ever. O mother, what shall I do? what shall I do?\"\ncried poor Jo, in despair.\"Watch and pray, dear; never get tired of trying; and never think it is\nimpossible to conquer your fault,\" said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy\nhead to her shoulder, and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo\ncried harder than ever.\"You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could\ndo anything when I'm in a passion; I get so savage, I could hurt any\none, and enjoy it. I'm afraid I _shall_ do something dreadful some day,\nand spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. O mother, help me, do\nhelp me!\"\"I will, my child, I will. Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this day,\nand resolve, with all your soul, that you will never know another like\nit. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours,\nand it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your\ntemper is the worst in the world; but mine used to be just like it.\"\"Yours, mother? Why, you are never angry!\" and, for the moment, Jo\nforgot remorse in surprise.\"I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in\ncontrolling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo; but I have\nlearned not to show it; and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though\nit may take me another forty years to do so.\""

I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you\nmight have had it,\" said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose\npossessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.\"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure-box; but\nmother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,\nand Laurie promised to send me all I want,\" replied Meg. \"Now, let me\nsee; there's my new gray walking-suit--just curl up the feather in my\nhat, Beth,--then my poplin, for Sunday, and the small party,--it looks\nheavy for spring, doesn't it? The violet silk would be so nice; oh,\ndear!\"\"Never mind; you've got the tarlatan for the big party, and you always\nlook like an angel in white,\" said Amy, brooding over the little store\nof finery in which her soul delighted.\"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to\ndo. My blue house-dress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that\nI feel as if I'd got a new one. My silk sacque isn't a bit the fashion,\nand my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's; I didn't like to say\nanything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told mother\nblack, with a white handle, but she forgot, and bought a green one, with\na yellowish handle. It's strong and neat, so I ought not to complain,\nbut I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one with a\ngold top,\" sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great\ndisfavor.\"Change it,\" advised Jo."

My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves\nare my comfort. You are a dear, to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich,\nand sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for\ncommon;\" and Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove-box.\"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her night-caps; would you put\nsome on mine?\" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,\nfresh from Hannah's hands.\"No, I wouldn't; for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns, without\nany trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn't rig,\" said Jo decidedly.\"I wonder if I shall _ever_ be happy enough to have real lace on my\nclothes, and bows on my caps?\" said Meg impatiently.\"You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only\ngo to Annie Moffat's,\" observed Beth, in her quiet way.\"So I did! Well, I _am_ happy, and I _won't_ fret; but it does seem as\nif the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There, now, the\ntrays are ready, and everything in but my ball-dress, which I shall\nleave for mother to pack,\" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from\nthe half-filled trunk to the many-times pressed and mended white\ntarlatan, which she called her \"ball-dress,\" with an important air.The next day was fine, and Meg departed, in style, for a fortnight of\nnovelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather\nreluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented\nthan she went. But she had begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to\ntake good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after\na winter of irksome work, that the mother yielded, and the daughter went\nto take her first taste of fashionable life."

  "content": "The Moffats _were_ very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted,\nat first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its\noccupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life\nthey led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt,\nwithout understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or\nintelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal\nthe ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was\nagreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best\nfrock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her\nexactly; and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of\nthose about her; to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,\ncrimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well\nas she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the more\nshe envied her, and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal\nas she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she\nwas a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves\nand silk stockings.She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls\nwere busily employed in \"having a good time.\" They shopped, walked,\nrode, and called all day; went to theatres and operas, or frolicked at\nhome in the evening; for Annie had many friends, and knew how to\nentertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one\nwas engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.\nMr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father; and Mrs.\nMoffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her\ndaughter had done. Every one petted her; and \"Daisy,\" as they called\nher, was in a fair way to have her head turned.When the evening for the \"small party\" came, she found that the poplin\nwouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses,\nand making themselves very fine indeed; so out came the tarlatan,\nlooking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new\none. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her\ncheeks began to burn, for, with all her gentleness, she was very proud.\nNo one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and\nAnnie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white\narms; but in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her\nheart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed,\nchattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter\nfeeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of\nflowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were\nexclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.\"It's for Belle, of course; George always sends her some, but these are\naltogether ravishing,\" cried Annie, with a great sniff.\"They are for Miss March, the man said. And here's a note,\" put in the\nmaid, holding it to Meg."

Didn't know you had a lover,\" cried the\ngirls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.\"The note is from mother, and the flowers from Laurie,\" said Meg simply,\nyet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.\"Oh, indeed!\" said Annie, with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note\ninto her pocket, as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false\npride; for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers\ncheered her up by their beauty.Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for\nherself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the\nbreasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that\nClara, the elder sister, told her she was \"the sweetest little thing she\never saw;\" and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.\nSomehow the kind act finished her despondency; and when all the rest\nwent to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed\nface in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair, and\nfastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so _very_\nshabby now.She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her\nheart's content; every one was very kind, and she had three compliments.\nAnnie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice;\nMajor Lincoln asked who \"the fresh little girl, with the beautiful\neyes,\" was; and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her, because she\n\"didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her,\" as he gracefully expressed\nit. So, altogether, she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit\nof a conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just\ninside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice,\nwhen she heard a voice ask, on the other side of the flowery wall,--\"How old is he?\"\"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,\" replied another voice.\"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it? Sallie\nsays they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\""

She _was_ proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it\nhelped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had\njust heard; for, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not\nhelp understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it,\nbut could not, and kept repeating to herself, \"Mrs. M. has made her\nplans,\" \"that fib about her mamma,\" and \"dowdy tarlatan,\" till she was\nready to cry, and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As\nthat was impossible, she did her best to seem gay; and, being rather\nexcited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she\nwas making. She was very glad when it was all over, and she was quiet in\nher bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached\nand her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish,\nyet well-meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed\nthe peace of the old one, in which, till now, she had lived as happily\nas a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoilt by the silly\nspeeches she had overheard; her faith in her mother was a little shaken\nby the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others\nby herself; and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple\nwardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter, was weakened by the\nunnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest\ncalamities under heaven.Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half\nresentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not\nspeaking out frankly, and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled\nthat morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even\nto take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her friends\nstruck Meg at once; they treated her with more respect, she thought;\ntook quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with\neyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered\nher, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her\nwriting, and said, with a sentimental air,--\"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for\nThursday. We should like to know him, and it's only a proper compliment\nto you.\"Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply\ndemurely,--\"You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't come.\"\"Why not, _chérie_?\" asked Miss Belle.\"He's too old.\"\"My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!\" cried Miss\nClara.\"Nearly seventy, I believe,\" answered Meg, counting stitches, to hide\nthe merriment in her eyes.\"You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man,\" exclaimed Miss\nBelle, laughing.\"There isn't any; Laurie is only a little boy,\" and Meg laughed also at\nthe queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her\nsupposed lover.\"About your age,\" Nan said.\"Nearer my sister Jo's; _I_ am seventeen in August,\" returned Meg,\ntossing her head.\"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?\" said Annie,\nlooking wise about nothing.\"Yes, he often does, to all of us; for their house is full, and we are\nso fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know,\nso it is quite natural that we children should play together;\" and Meg\nhoped they would say no more.\"It's evident Daisy isn't out yet,\" said Miss Clara to Belle, with a\nnod."

How funny--\" She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook\nher head at her, and broke in, saying kindly,--\"Not at all; where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn't\nout? There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen,\nfor I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown, and you\nshall wear it, to please me, won't you, dear?\"\"You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress, if you don't; it does\nwell enough for a little girl like me,\" said Meg.\"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do\nit, and you'd be a regular little beauty, with a touch here and there. I\nsha'n't let any one see you till you are done, and then we'll burst upon\nthem like Cinderella and her godmother, going to the ball,\" said Belle,\nin her persuasive tone.Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she\nwould be \"a little beauty\" after touching up, caused her to accept, and\nforget all her former uncomfortable feelings towards the Moffats."

They crimped and curled\nher hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,\ntouched her lips with coralline salve, to make them redder, and Hortense\nwould have added \"a _soupçon_ of rouge,\" if Meg had not rebelled. They\nlaced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly\nbreathe, and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in\nthe mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,\nbrooch, and even ear-rings, for Hortense tied them on, with a bit of\npink silk, which did not show. A cluster of tea-rosebuds at the bosom,\nand a _ruche_, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty white\nshoulders, and a pair of high-heeled blue silk boots satisfied the last\nwish of her heart. A laced handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a\nsilver holder finished her off; and Miss Belle surveyed her with the\nsatisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.\"Mademoiselle is charmante, très jolie, is she not?\" cried Hortense,\nclasping her hands in an affected rapture.\"Come and show yourself,\" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room\nwhere the others were waiting.As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her ear-rings\ntinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her\n\"fun\" had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that\nshe _was_ \"a little beauty.\" Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase\nenthusiastically; and, for several minutes, she stood, like the jackdaw\nin the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered\nlike a party of magpies.\"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt,\nand those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver\nbutterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,\nClara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,\" said\nBelle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.\"I'm afraid to go down, I feel so queer and stiff and half-dressed,\"\nsaid Meg to Sallie, as the bell rang, and Mrs. Moffat sent to ask the\nyoung ladies to appear at once.\"You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere\nbeside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I\nassure you. Let your flowers hang; don't be so careful of them, and be\nsure you don't trip,\" returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was\nprettier than herself.[Illustration: Asked to be introduced]"

She very soon discovered that there is a charm\nabout fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people, and secures\ntheir respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her\nbefore, were very affectionate all of a sudden; several young gentlemen,\nwho had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but\nasked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but agreeable\nthings to her; and several old ladies, who sat on sofas, and criticised\nthe rest of the party, inquired who she was, with an air of interest.\nShe heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them,--\"Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first families,\nbut reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences;\nsweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.\"\"Dear me!\" said the old lady, putting up her glass for another\nobservation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard, and been\nrather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs.The \"queer feeling\" did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting\nthe new part of fine lady, and so got on pretty well, though the tight\ndress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and\nshe was in constant fear lest her ear-rings should fly off, and get lost\nor broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of\na young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped\nlaughing and looked confused; for, just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was\nstaring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she\nthought; for, though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest\neyes made her blush, and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her\nconfusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to\nLaurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.\"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head! I won't care for\nit, or let it change me a bit,\" thought Meg, and rustled across the room\nto shake hands with her friend.\"I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't,\" she said, with her most\ngrown-up air.\"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did;\" answered\nLaurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her\nmaternal tone.\"What shall you tell her?\" asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his\nopinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him, for the first time.\"I shall say I didn't know you; for you look so grown-up, and unlike\nyourself, I'm quite afraid of you,\" he said, fumbling at his\nglove-button."

As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by; and, a minute after,\nshe heard him saying to his mother,--\"They are making a fool of that little girl; I wanted you to see her,\nbut they have spoilt her entirely; she's nothing but a doll, to-night.\"\"Oh, dear!\" sighed Meg; \"I wish I'd been sensible, and worn my own\nthings; then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so\nuncomfortable and ashamed myself.\"She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the\ncurtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one\ntouched her; and, turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said,\nwith his very best bow, and his hand out,--\"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.\"\"I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,\" said Meg, trying to\nlook offended, and failing entirely.\"Not a bit of it; I'm dying to do it.
