One July day she came in with her hands full,\nand went about the house leaving letters and parcels, like the penny\npost.\"Here's your posy, mother! Laurie never forgets that,\" she said, putting\nthe fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \"Marmee's corner,\" and was\nkept supplied by the affectionate boy.\"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\" continued Beth, delivering the\narticles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.\"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\" said Meg, looking\nat the gray cotton glove.\"Didn't you drop the other in the garden?\"\"No, I'm sure I didn't; for there was only one in the office.\""

Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she\npinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she\nbe taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready\nfor either good or bad news.

Meg had an extra row of\nlittle curl-papers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her\nafflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to\natone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by\nputting a clothes-pin on her nose, to uplift the offending feature. It\nwas one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their\ndrawing-boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the\npurpose to which it was now put.

The lawn was the reception-room, and for several minutes a\nlively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate,\nthough twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would\ndo well to imitate; and she was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances\nthat he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie \"primmed up\nhis mouth\" when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a\nstand-off-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free\nand easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the\nnew boys, and decided that the lame one was not \"dreadful,\" but gentle\nand feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found\nGrace a well-mannered, merry little person; and after staring dumbly at\none another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends."

Laurie and Jo rowed one boat;\nMr. Brooke and Ned the other; while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did\nhis best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed\nwater-bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of\ngeneral utility; it broke the ice in the beginning, by producing a\nlaugh; it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro, as she\nrowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a\nshower came up, she said. Kate looked rather amazed at Jo's proceedings,\nespecially as she exclaimed \"Christopher Columbus!\" when she lost her\noar; and Laurie said, \"My dear fellow, did I hurt you?\" when he tripped\nover her feet in taking his place. But after putting up her glass to\nexamine the queer girl several times, Miss Kate decided that she was\n\"odd, but rather clever,\" and smiled upon her from afar.[Illustration: Mr. Laurence waving his hat]Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the\nrowers, who both admired the prospect, and feathered their oars with\nuncommon \"skill and dexterity.\" Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\nman, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet\nmanners, and considered him a walking encyclopædia of useful knowledge.\nHe never talked to her much; but he looked at her a good deal, and she\nfelt sure that he did not regard her with aversion.

The Englishers played well; but the Americans played\nbetter, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the\nspirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes, and\nonce narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket, and\nhad missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was\nclose behind her, and his turn came before hers; he gave a stroke, his\nball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was\nvery near; and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\ntoe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\"I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\nthe young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.[Illustration: Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you]\"You pushed it; I saw you; it's my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\"Upon my word, I didn't move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\nallowed; so stand off, please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\nangrily.\"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!\"\nreturned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,\ncolored up to her forehead, and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\nwith all her might, while Fred hit the stake, and declared himself out\nwith much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time\nfinding it, among the bushes; but she came back, looking cool and quiet,\nand waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the\nplace she had lost; and, when she got there, the other side had nearly\nwon, for Kate's ball was the last but one, and lay near the stake.\"By George, it's all up with us! Good-by, Kate.

A very merry lunch it was; for everything\nseemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a\nvenerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the\ntable, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates; acorns dropped\ninto the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without\nbeing invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree, to see\nwhat was going on.

Every day, when he gave his lessons to\nthis pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city; and, as\nhe rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had\nseen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went\nprancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle\nthe lovely face.

The\nknight wished intensely that he could free them; but he was poor, and\ncould only go by each day, watching for the sweet face, and longing to\nsee it out in the sunshine.

The hot weather made him indolent, and he had\nshirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost,\ndispleased his grandfather by practising half the afternoon, frightened\nthe maid-servants half out of their wits, by mischievously hinting that\none of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stable-man\nabout some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his\nhammock, to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the\npeace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself.

Each wore a large, flapping\nhat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long\nstaff.

Taking the shortest way to the boat-house, he\nwaited for them to appear: but no one came, and he went up the hill to\ntake an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from\nthe heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of\nthe pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.\"Here's a landscape!\" thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and\nlooking wide-awake and good-natured already."
