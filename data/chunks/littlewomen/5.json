  "content": "Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which\nJo underwent that morning; and the dinner she served up became a\nstanding joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone,\nand discovered that something more than energy and good-will is\nnecessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour, and was\ngrieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.\nThe bread burnt black; for the salad-dressing so aggravated her, that\nshe let everything else go till she had convinced herself that she could\nnot make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but\nshe hammered and poked, till it was unshelled, and its meagre\nproportions concealed in a grove of lettuce-leaves. The potatoes had to\nbe hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at\nlast. The blanc-mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as\nthey looked, having been skilfully \"deaconed.\"\"Well, they can eat beef, and bread and butter, if they are hungry; only\nit's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing,\"\nthought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and\nstood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread for\nLaurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose\ncurious eyes would mark all failures, and whose tattling tongue would\nreport them far and wide.Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after\nanother was tasted and left; while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed,\nMiss Crocker pursed up her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all\nhis might, to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo's one strong\npoint was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of\nrich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew\na long breath, as the pretty glass plates went round, and every one\nlooked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream.\nMiss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water\nhastily. Jo, who had refused, thinking there might not be enough, for\nthey dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he\nwas eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his\nmouth, and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of\ndelicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her\nnapkin, and left the table precipitately.[Illustration: Miss Crocker made a wry face]\"Oh, what is it?\" exclaimed Jo trembling.\"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,\" replied Meg, with a\ntragic gesture."

  "content": "Jo uttered a groan, and fell back in her chair; remembering that she had\ngiven a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes\non the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the\nrefrigerator. She turned scarlet, and was on the verge of crying, when\nshe met Laurie's eyes, which _would_ look merry in spite of his heroic\nefforts; the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she\nlaughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did every one else, even\n\"Croaker,\" as the girls called the old lady; and the unfortunate dinner\nended gayly, with bread and butter, olives and fun.\"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober\nourselves with a funeral,\" said Jo, as they rose; and Miss Crocker made\nready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's\ndinner-table.They did sober themselves, for Beth's sake; Laurie dug a grave under the\nferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears, by his\ntender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of\nviolets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,\ncomposed by Jo, while she struggled with the dinner:--\"Here lies Pip March,\n           Who died the 7th of June;\n         Loved and lamented sore,\n           And not forgotten soon.\"At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome\nwith emotion and lobster; but there was no place of repose, for the beds\nwere not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up\npillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the\nremains of the feast, which took half the afternoon, and left them so\ntired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper.\nLaurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour\ncream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs. March came\nhome to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the\nafternoon; and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of\none part of the experiment.Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a\nscramble to get ready to see them; then tea must be got, errands done;\nand one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected till the last minute.\nAs twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered in the porch\nwhere the June roses were budding beautifully, and each groaned or\nsighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.\"What a dreadful day this has been!\" begun Jo, usually the first to\nspeak.\"It has seemed shorter than usual, but _so_ uncomfortable,\" said Meg.\"Not a bit like home,\" added Amy."

While Hannah and I did your work, you got on\npretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable; so I\nthought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when every\none thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that it is pleasanter to help\none another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it\ncomes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely\nto us all?\"\"We do, mother, we do!\" cried the girls.\"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again; for though\nthey seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn\nto carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for every one; it\nkeeps us from _ennui_ and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and\ngives us a sense of power and independence better than money or\nfashion.\""

I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing; that will be\nbetter than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as\nthey are,\" said Meg.\"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music\nand dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not playing,\"\nwas Beth's resolution; while Amy followed their example by heroically\ndeclaring, \"I shall learn to make button-holes, and attend to my parts\nof speech.\"\"Very good! then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy\nthat we shall not have to repeat it; only don't go to the other extreme,\nand delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work and play; make each\nday both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of\ntime by employing it well.

One July day she came in with her hands full,\nand went about the house leaving letters and parcels, like the penny\npost.\"Here's your posy, mother! Laurie never forgets that,\" she said, putting\nthe fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in \"Marmee's corner,\" and was\nkept supplied by the affectionate boy.\"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,\" continued Beth, delivering the\narticles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.\"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,\" said Meg, looking\nat the gray cotton glove.\"Didn't you drop the other in the garden?\"\"No, I'm sure I didn't; for there was only one in the office.\""

My\nletter is only a translation of the German song I wanted; I think Mr.\nBrooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing.\"Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham\nmorning-gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very\nwomanly, as she sat sewing at her little work-table, full of tidy white\nrolls; so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she sewed\nand sung, while her fingers flew, and her thoughts were busied with\ngirlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that\nMrs. March smiled, and was satisfied.\"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered\nthe whole post-office, stuck outside,\" said Beth, laughing, as she went\ninto the study, where Jo sat writing.\"What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the\nfashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, 'Why mind the\nfashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I said I would if I had\none, and he has sent me this, to try me. I'll wear it, for fun, and show\nhim I _don't_ care for the fashion;\" and, hanging the antique broad-brim\non a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said\nto her,--\"MY DEAR:\"I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I\n    watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about\n    your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no\n    one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may\n    trust the well-worn cover of your guide-book. _I_, too, have\n    seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your\n    resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear,\n    patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one\n    sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving\"MOTHER.\"\"That does me good! that's worth millions of money and pecks of praise.\nO Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I\nhave you to help me.\""

Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she\npinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she\nbe taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready\nfor either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote,--\"DEAR JO,\n                 What ho!Some English girls and boys are coming to see me to-morrow and\n    I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch\n    my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and\n    croquet,--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all\n    sorts of larks. They are nice people, and like such things.\n    Brooke will go, to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will\n    play propriety for the girls.

Do you know anything\nabout them, Jo?\" asked Meg.\"Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and\nFrank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or\nten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys; I fancied, from the\nway he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire\nKate much.\"\"I'm so glad my French print is clean; it's just the thing, and so\nbecoming!\" observed Meg complacently. \"Have you anything decent, Jo?\"\"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and\ntramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of.

Each had made such preparation\nfor the fête as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of\nlittle curl-papers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her\nafflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to\natone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by\nputting a clothes-pin on her nose, to uplift the offending feature. It\nwas one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their\ndrawing-boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the\npurpose to which it was now put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse\nthe sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up, and\nroused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.[Illustration: Amy capped the climax by putting a clothes-pin on her\n                                 nose]Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a\nlively bustle began in both houses.

Oh, mercy me! here's a carriage full\nof people--a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is\nlame; poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell us that. Be\nquick, girls! it's getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.\nLook, Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day, when we were\nshopping?\"\"So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the\nMountains. There is Sallie; I'm glad she got back in time. Am I all\nright, Jo?\" cried Meg, in a flutter.\"A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat straight; it looks\nsentimental tipped that way, and will fly off at the first puff. Now,\nthen, come on!\"\"O Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too absurd!

It\nwill make fun; and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable.\" With\nthat Jo marched straight away, and the rest followed,--a bright little\nband of sisters, all looking their best, in summer suits, with happy\nfaces under the jaunty hat-brims.Laurie ran to meet, and present them to his friends, in the most cordial\nmanner. The lawn was the reception-room, and for several minutes a\nlively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate,\nthough twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would\ndo well to imitate; and she was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances\nthat he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie \"primmed up\nhis mouth\" when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a\nstand-off-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free\nand easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the\nnew boys, and decided that the lame one was not \"dreadful,\" but gentle\nand feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found\nGrace a well-mannered, merry little person; and after staring dumbly at\none another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends."

Laurie and Jo rowed one boat;\nMr. Brooke and Ned the other; while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did\nhis best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed\nwater-bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of\ngeneral utility; it broke the ice in the beginning, by producing a\nlaugh; it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro, as she\nrowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a\nshower came up, she said. Kate looked rather amazed at Jo's proceedings,\nespecially as she exclaimed \"Christopher Columbus!\" when she lost her\noar; and Laurie said, \"My dear fellow, did I hurt you?\" when he tripped\nover her feet in taking his place. But after putting up her glass to\nexamine the queer girl several times, Miss Kate decided that she was\n\"odd, but rather clever,\" and smiled upon her from afar.[Illustration: Mr. Laurence waving his hat]Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the\nrowers, who both admired the prospect, and feathered their oars with\nuncommon \"skill and dexterity.\" Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young\nman, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet\nmanners, and considered him a walking encyclopædia of useful knowledge.\nHe never talked to her much; but he looked at her a good deal, and she\nfelt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in\ncollege, of course put on all the airs which Freshmen think it their\nbounden duty to assume; he was not very wise, but very good-natured, and\naltogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was\nabsorbed in keeping her white piqué dress clean, and chattering with the\nubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.It was not far to Longmeadow; but the tent was pitched and the wickets\ndown by the time they arrived.

The Englishers played well; but the Americans played\nbetter, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the\nspirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes, and\nonce narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket, and\nhad missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was\nclose behind her, and his turn came before hers; he gave a stroke, his\nball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was\nvery near; and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his\ntoe, which put it just an inch on the right side.\"I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first,\" cried\nthe young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.[Illustration: Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you]\"You pushed it; I saw you; it's my turn now,\" said Jo sharply.\"Upon my word, I didn't move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is\nallowed; so stand off, please, and let me have a go at the stake.\"\"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose,\" said Jo\nangrily.\"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!\"\nreturned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time,\ncolored up to her forehead, and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket\nwith all her might, while Fred hit the stake, and declared himself out\nwith much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time\nfinding it, among the bushes; but she came back, looking cool and quiet,\nand waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the\nplace she had lost; and, when she got there, the other side had nearly\nwon, for Kate's ball was the last but one, and lay near the stake.\"By George, it's all up with us! Good-by, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so\nyou are finished,\" cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see\nthe finish.\"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,\" said Jo, with\na look that made the lad redden, \"especially when they beat them,\" she\nadded, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a clever\nstroke.Laurie threw up his hat; then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult\nover the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of a cheer to\nwhisper to his friend,--\"Good for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him; we can't tell him so, but he\nwon't do it again, take my word for it.\"Meg drew her aside, under pretence of pinning up a loose braid, and said\napprovingly,--\"It was dreadfully provoking; but you kept your temper, and I'm so glad,\nJo.\""

  "content": "\"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune,\nfor he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He travelled a long\nwhile, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he\ncame to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to any\none who would tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was\nvery fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely; for\nthe colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master,\nthough he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to\nthis pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city; and, as\nhe rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had\nseen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went\nprancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle\nthe lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old\ncastle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by\na spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The\nknight wished intensely that he could free them; but he was poor, and\ncould only go by each day, watching for the sweet face, and longing to\nsee it out in the sunshine. At last, he resolved to get into the castle\nand ask how he could help them. He went and knocked; the great door flew\nopen, and he beheld--\"[Illustration: He went prancing down a quiet street]\"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, 'At\nlast! at last!'\" continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired\nthe style. \"''Tis she!' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an\necstasy of joy. 'Oh, rise!' she said, extending a hand of marble\nfairness. 'Never! till you tell me how I may rescue you,' swore the\nknight, still kneeling. 'Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here\ntill my tyrant is destroyed.' 'Where is the villain?' 'In the mauve\nsalon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' 'I obey, and return\nvictorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away, and\nflinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he\nreceived--\"[Illustration: \"Oh, rise,\" she said]\"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a\nblack gown fired at him,\" said Ned. \"Instantly Sir What's-his-name\nrecovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to\njoin the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow; found the door\nlocked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got half-way down when\nthe ladder broke, and he went head first into the moat, sixty feet\nbelow. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to\na little door guarded by two stout fellows; knocked their heads together\ntill they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of\nhis prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone\nsteps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and\nspiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March. At the top\nof these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and\nchilled his blood--\"[Illustration: A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon]"

They reached a curtained\ndoor, behind which sounded lovely music; he sprang forward to enter, but\nthe spectre plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a--\"\"Snuff-box,\" said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the\naudience. \"'Thankee,' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch, and\nsneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off.

The Portuguese\nheld his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars\ncheered like mad.

By and by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, 'I'll give\nyou this box of pearls if you can take it up;' for she wanted to restore\nthe poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself. So\nthe diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed, on opening it, to\nfind no pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found\nby a--\"\"Little goose-girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,\" said\nAmy, when Sallie's invention gave out. \"The little girl was sorry for\nthem, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. 'Your\ngeese will tell you, they know everything,' said the old woman. So she\nasked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost,\nand all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed--\"\"'Cabbages!'\" continued Laurie promptly. \"'Just the thing,' said the\ngirl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on,\nthe knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way\nrejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other\nheads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The\nknight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and\nlearned that the princesses had spun themselves free, and all gone to be\nmarried, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that; and mounting\nthe colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle\nto see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his\naffections picking flowers in her garden. 'Will you give me a rose?'\nsaid he. 'You must come and get it. I can't come to you; it isn't\nproper,' said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge,\nbut it seemed to grow higher and higher; then he tried to push through,\nbut it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently\nbroke twig after twig, till he had made a little hole, through which he\npeeped, saying imploringly, 'Let me in! let me in!' But the pretty\nprincess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly,\nand left him to fight his way in. Whether he did or not, Frank will tell\nyou.\"[Illustration: Will you give me a rose?]\"I can't; I'm not playing, I never do,\" said Frank, dismayed at the\nsentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple.\nBeth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep."
