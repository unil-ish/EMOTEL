The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done,\nand we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.\"\"Yes, I should think so;\" and Laurie thought regretfully of his own idle\ndays.\"Mother likes to have us out of doors as much as possible; so we bring\nour work here, and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our\nthings in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,\nand play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the\n'Delectable Mountain,' for we can look far away and see the country\nwhere we hope to live some time.\"Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine; for through an opening in the\nwood one could look across the wide, blue river, the meadows on the\nother side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills\nthat rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens plowed with\nthe splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds lay on the\nhill-tops; and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white\npeaks, that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.\"How beautiful that is!\" said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see and\nfeel beauty of any kind.\"It's often so; and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but\nalways splendid,\" replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.\"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live some time,--the real\ncountry, she means, with pigs and chickens, and haymaking. It would be\nnice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could\never go to it,\" said Beth musingly.\"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we _shall_ go, by and\nby, when we are good enough,\" answered Meg, with her sweet voice.\"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do; I want to fly away at once, as\nthose swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.\"\"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later; no fear of that,\" said Jo;\n\"I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and\nmaybe never get in after all.\""

If I\narrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, Beth?\"Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend; but she said\ncheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, \"If people\nreally want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will get\nin; for I don't believe there are any locks on that door, or any guards\nat the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the\nshining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor Christian as he\ncomes up from the river.\"\"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could\ncome true, and we could live in them?\" said Jo, after a little pause.\"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have,\"\nsaid Laurie, lying flat, and throwing cones at the squirrel who had\nbetrayed him.\"You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it?\" asked Meg.\"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?\"\"Yes, if the girls will too.\"\"We will. Now, Laurie.\"\"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle in\nGermany, and have just as much music as I choose. I'm to be a famous\nmusician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me; and I'm never\nto be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself, and live\nfor what I like. That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg?\"Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake\nbefore her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said\nslowly, \"I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of luxurious\nthings,--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people,\nand heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like,\nwith plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit. How I should enjoy\nit! for I wouldn't be idle, but do good, and make every one love me\ndearly.\"[Illustration: Waved a brake before her face]\"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?\" asked Laurie\nslyly.\"I said 'pleasant people,' you know;\" and Meg carefully tied up her shoe\nas she spoke, so that no one saw her face."

You know your castle wouldn't be perfect\nwithout,\" said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather\nscorned romance, except in books.\"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,\"\nanswered Meg petulantly.\"Wouldn't I, though? I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms\npiled with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that my\nworks should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to do something\nsplendid before I go into my castle,--something heroic or wonderful,\nthat won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know what, but I'm on\nthe watch for it, and mean to astonish you all, some day. I think I\nshall write books, and get rich and famous: that would suit me, so that\nis _my_ favorite dream.\"\"Mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother, and help take care\nof the family,\" said Beth contentedly.\"Don't you wish for anything else?\" asked Laurie.\"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we\nmay all keep well and be together; nothing else.\"\"I have ever so many wishes; but the pet one is to be an artist, and go\nto Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole\nworld,\" was Amy's modest desire.\"We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth, wants to\nbe rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if any of\nus will ever get our wishes,\" said Laurie, chewing grass, like a\nmeditative calf.\"I've got the key to my castle in the air; but whether I can unlock the\ndoor remains to be seen,\" observed Jo mysteriously.\"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang college!\"\nmuttered Laurie, with an impatient sigh.\"Here's mine!\" and Amy waved her pencil.\"I haven't got any,\" said Meg forlornly.\"Yes, you have,\" said Laurie at once.\"Where?\"\"In your face.\"\"Nonsense; that's of no use.\"\"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,\" replied\nthe boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he\nfancied he knew."

What a venerable party!\" said Jo.\"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time; but I'm\nsuch a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall 'dawdle,' Jo.\"\"You need a motive, mother says; and when you get it, she is sure you'll\nwork splendidly.\"\"Is she? By Jupiter I will, if I only get the chance!\" cried Laurie,\nsitting up with sudden energy. \"I ought to be satisfied to please\ngrandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see,\nand comes hard. He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and I'd\nrather be shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of\nrubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the\nbottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I\ngive him four years he ought to let me off from the business; but he's\nset, and I 've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and please\nmyself, as my father did. If there was any one left to stay with the old\ngentleman, I'd do it to-morrow.\"Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into\nexecution on the slightest provocation; for he was growing up very fast,\nand, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of\nsubjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.\"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home\nagain till you have tried your own way,\" said Jo, whose imagination was\nfired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was\nexcited by what she called \"Teddy's wrongs.\""

You should do just what your grandfather wishes,\nmy dear boy,\" said Meg, in her most maternal tone. \"Do your best at\ncollege, and, when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he won't\nbe hard or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with\nand love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you left him without\nhis permission. Don't be dismal or fret, but do your duty; and you'll\nget your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved.\"\"What do you know about him?\" asked Laurie, grateful for the good\nadvice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation\nfrom himself, after his unusual outbreak.\"Only what your grandpa told us about him,--how he took good care of his\nown mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice\nperson, because he wouldn't leave her; and how he provides now for an\nold woman who nursed his mother; and never tells any one, but is just as\ngenerous and patient and good as he can be.\"\"So he is, dear old fellow!\" said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused,\nlooking flushed and earnest with her story. \"It's like grandpa to find\nout all about him, without letting him know, and to tell all his\ngoodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't\nunderstand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me,\nand treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just\nperfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you\nall in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll do for\nBrooke.\"\"Begin to do something now, by not plaguing his life out,\" said Meg\nsharply.\"How do you know I do, miss?\"\"I can always tell by his face, when he goes away. If you have been\ngood, he looks satisfied and walks briskly; if you have plagued him,\nhe's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work\nbetter.\"\"Well, I like that! So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in\nBrooke's face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he passes your window,\nbut I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.\"[Illustration: I see him bow and smile]\"We haven't; don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything! It\nwas only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here is\nsaid in confidence, you know,\" cried Meg, much alarmed at the thought of\nwhat might follow from her careless speech."

I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be\nsilly; I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd be\nsorry for, by and by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were our\nbrother, and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.\" And\nMeg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand,\nand said frankly, \"I'm the one to be forgiven; I'm cross, and have been\nout of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults and be\nsisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes; I thank you all the\nsame.\"Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable\nas possible,--wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook\ndown cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a\nfit person to belong to the \"Busy Bee Society.\" In the midst of an\nanimated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those\namiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of\na bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea \"to draw,\" and they would\njust have time to get home to supper.\"May I come again?\" asked Laurie.\"Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are\ntold to do,\" said Meg smiling.\"I'll try.\"\"Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do;\nthere's a demand for socks just now,\" added Jo, waving hers, like a big\nblue worsted banner, as they parted at the gate."

Remembering the conversation of the\nafternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the\nsacrifice cheerfully, \"I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old\ngentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.\"[Illustration: Tail-piece][Illustration: Jo was very busy]XIV.SECRETS.Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow\nchilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun\nlay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa,\nwriting busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her,\nwhile Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied\nby his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of\nhis whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the\nlast page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish, and\nthrew down her pen, exclaiming,--\"There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to wait till\nI can do better.\"Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through,\nmaking dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points,\nwhich looked like little balloons; then she tied it up with a smart red\nribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression,\nwhich plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo's desk up here\nwas an old tin kitchen, which hung against the wall. In it she kept her\npapers and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being\nlikewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of\nsuch books as were left in his way, by eating the leaves. From this tin\nreceptacle Jo produced another manuscript; and, putting both in her\npocket, crept quietly down stairs, leaving her friends to nibble her\npens and taste her ink.She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and, going to\nthe back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung\nherself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.\nOnce there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled\naway to town, looking very merry and mysterious."

This\nmanœuvre she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a\nblack-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building\nopposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake,\npulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if\nshe were going to have all her teeth out.There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance,\nand, after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly\nopened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young\ngentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself\nin the opposite door-way, saying, with a smile and a shiver,--\"It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need some\none to help her home.\"In ten minutes Jo came running down stairs with a very red face, and the\ngeneral appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying\nordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked\nanything but pleased, and passed him with a nod; but he followed, asking\nwith an air of sympathy,--\"Did you have a bad time?\"\"Not very.\"\"You got through quickly.\"\"Yes, thank goodness!\"\"Why did you go alone?\"\"Didn't want any one to know.\"\"You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?\"Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him; then began to\nlaugh, as if mightily amused at something.\"There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.\"\"What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo,\" said\nLaurie, looking mystified.\"So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?\"\"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a\ngymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.\"\"I'm glad of that.\"\"Why?\"\"You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and\nwe'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.\"Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several\npassers-by smile in spite of themselves.\"I'll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not; it's grand fun, and will\nstraighten you up capitally. But I don't believe that was your only\nreason for saying 'I'm glad,' in that decided way; was it, now?\"\"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you\nnever go to such places. Do you?\"\"Not often.\"\"I wish you wouldn't.\""

I did\nhope you'd stay respectable, and be a satisfaction to your friends,\"\nsaid Jo, shaking her head.\"Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without\nlosing his respectability?\" asked Laurie, looking nettled.\"That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don't like Ned and his\nset, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let us have him at our\nhouse, though he wants to come; and if you grow like him she won't be\nwilling to have us frolic together as we do now.\"\"Won't she?\" asked Laurie anxiously.\"No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us all up in\nbandboxes rather than have us associate with them.\"\"Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet; I'm not a fashionable\nparty, and don't mean to be; but I do like harmless larks now and then,\ndon't you?\"\"Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you? or\nthere will be an end of all our good times.\"\"I'll be a double-distilled saint.\"\"I can't bear saints: just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and\nwe'll never desert you.

Much obliged.\"\"No, I don't--oh, _dear_, no!--but I hear people talking about money\nbeing such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor; I shouldn't\nworry then.\"\"Do you worry about me, Jo?\"\"A little, when you look moody or discontented, as you sometimes do; for\nyou've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I'm afraid\nit would be hard to stop you.\"Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she\nhad held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips still\nsmiled as if at her warnings."

He saw the trouble in her face, and\ndrew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, \"Where have you been\ncalling, all so fine?\"\"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle\nMoffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend the\nwinter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be!\"\"Do you envy her, Meg?\" said Laurie.\"I'm afraid I do.\"\"I'm glad of it!\" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.\"Why?\" asked Meg, looking surprised.\"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a\npoor man,\" said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to\nmind what she said."

She rushed to the door when the postman rang; was rude to\nMr. Brooke whenever they met; would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone\nface, occasionally jumping up to shake, and then to kiss her, in a very\nmysterious manner; Laurie and she were always making signs to one\nanother, and talking about \"Spread Eagles,\" till the girls declared they\nhad both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the\nwindow, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the\nsight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden, and finally capturing\nher in Amy's bower. What went on there, Meg could not see; but shrieks\nof laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great\nflapping of newspapers.\"What shall we do with that girl? She never _will_ behave like a young\nlady,\" sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.\"I hope she won't; she is so funny and dear as she is,\" said Beth, who\nhad never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets\nwith any one but her.\"It's very trying, but we never can make her _commy la fo_,\" added Amy,\nwho sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a\nvery becoming way,--two agreeable things, which made her feel unusually\nelegant and ladylike.In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected\nto read.[Illustration: Jo laid herself on the sofa and affected to read]\"Have you anything interesting there?\" asked Meg, with condescension.\"Nothing but a story; won't amount to much, I guess,\" returned Jo,\ncarefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.\"You'd better read it aloud; that will amuse us and keep you out of\nmischief,\" said Amy, in her most grown-up tone.\"What's the name?\" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind the\nsheet.\"The Rival Painters.\"\"That sounds well; read it,\" said Meg."

Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite\nnames; isn't that queer?\" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the \"lovering\npart\" was tragical.\"Who wrote it?\" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face.The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed\ncountenance, and, with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement,\nreplied in a loud voice, \"Your sister.\"\"You?\" cried Meg, dropping her work.\"It's very good,\" said Amy critically.\"I knew it! I knew it! O my Jo, I _am_ so proud!\" and Beth ran to hug\nher sister, and exult over this splendid success.Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! how Meg wouldn't\nbelieve it till she saw the words, \"Miss Josephine March,\" actually\nprinted in the paper; how graciously Amy criticised the artistic parts\nof the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately\ncouldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead; how Beth got\nexcited, and skipped and sung with joy; how Hannah came in to exclaim\n\"Sakes alive, well I never!\" in great astonishment at \"that Jo's\ndoin's;\" how proud Mrs. March was when she knew it; how Jo laughed, with\ntears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock and\ndone with it; and how the \"Spread Eagle\" might be said to flap his wings\ntriumphantly over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to\nhand.\"Tell us all about it.\" \"When did it come?\" \"How much did you get for\nit?\" \"What _will_ father say?\" \"Won't Laurie laugh?\" cried the family,\nall in one breath, as they clustered about Jo; for these foolish,\naffectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy."
