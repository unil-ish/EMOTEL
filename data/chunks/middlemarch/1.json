  "content": "It had now entered Dorothea’s mind that Mr. Casaubon might wish to make\nher his wife, and the idea that he would do so touched her with a sort\nof reverential gratitude. How good of him—nay, it would be almost as if\na winged messenger had suddenly stood beside her path and held out his\nhand towards her! For a long while she had been oppressed by the\nindefiniteness which hung in her mind, like a thick summer haze, over\nall her desire to make her life greatly effective. What could she do,\nwhat ought she to do?—she, hardly more than a budding woman, but yet\nwith an active conscience and a great mental need, not to be satisfied\nby a girlish instruction comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a\ndiscursive mouse. With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, she\nmight have thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find\nher ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler\nclergy, the perusal of “Female Scripture Characters,” unfolding the\nprivate experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas under\nthe New, and the care of her soul over her embroidery in her own\nboudoir—with a background of prospective marriage to a man who, if less\nstrict than herself, as being involved in affairs religiously\ninexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted. From such\ncontentment poor Dorothea was shut out. The intensity of her religious\ndisposition, the coercion it exercised over her life, was but one\naspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually\nconsequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow\nteaching, hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a\nlabyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no\nwhither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration\nand inconsistency. The thing which seemed to her best, she wanted to\njustify by the completest knowledge; and not to live in a pretended\nadmission of rules which were never acted on. Into this soul-hunger as\nyet all her youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her\nwas one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own\nignorance, and give her the freedom of voluntary submission to a guide\nwho would take her along the grandest path."

  "content": "“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking\nquickly along the bridle road through the wood. “It would be my duty to\nstudy that I might help him the better in his great works. There would\nbe nothing trivial about our lives. Every-day things with us would mean\nthe greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal. I should learn\nto see the truth by the same light as great men have seen it by. And\nthen I should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it\nwas possible to lead a grand life here—now—in England. I don’t feel\nsure about doing good in any way now: everything seems like going on a\nmission to a people whose language I don’t know;—unless it were\nbuilding good cottages—there can be no doubt about that. Oh, I hope I\nshould be able to get the people well housed in Lowick! I will draw\nplenty of plans while I have time.”Dorothea checked herself suddenly with self-rebuke for the presumptuous\nway in which she was reckoning on uncertain events, but she was spared\nany inward effort to change the direction of her thoughts by the\nappearance of a cantering horseman round a turning of the road. The\nwell-groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful setters could leave no\ndoubt that the rider was Sir James Chettam. He discerned Dorothea,\njumped off his horse at once, and, having delivered it to his groom,\nadvanced towards her with something white on his arm, at which the two\nsetters were barking in an excited manner.“How delightful to meet you, Miss Brooke,” he said, raising his hat and\nshowing his sleekly waving blond hair. “It has hastened the pleasure I\nwas looking forward to.”"

  "content": "Miss Brooke was annoyed at the interruption. This amiable baronet,\nreally a suitable husband for Celia, exaggerated the necessity of\nmaking himself agreeable to the elder sister. Even a prospective\nbrother-in-law may be an oppression if he will always be presupposing\ntoo good an understanding with you, and agreeing with you even when you\ncontradict him. The thought that he had made the mistake of paying his\naddresses to herself could not take shape: all her mental activity was\nused up in persuasions of another kind. But he was positively obtrusive\nat this moment, and his dimpled hands were quite disagreeable. Her\nroused temper made her color deeply, as she returned his greeting with\nsome haughtiness.Sir James interpreted the heightened color in the way most gratifying\nto himself, and thought he never saw Miss Brooke looking so handsome.“I have brought a little petitioner,” he said, “or rather, I have\nbrought him to see if he will be approved before his petition is\noffered.” He showed the white object under his arm, which was a tiny\nMaltese puppy, one of nature’s most naive toys.“It is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely as\npets,” said Dorothea, whose opinion was forming itself that very moment\n(as opinions will) under the heat of irritation.“Oh, why?” said Sir James, as they walked forward.“I believe all the petting that is given them does not make them happy.\nThey are too helpless: their lives are too frail. A weasel or a mouse\nthat gets its own living is more interesting. I like to think that the\nanimals about us have souls something like our own, and either carry on\ntheir own little affairs or can be companions to us, like Monk here.\nThose creatures are parasitic.”“I am so glad I know that you do not like them,” said good Sir James.\n“I should never keep them for myself, but ladies usually are fond of\nthese Maltese dogs. Here, John, take this dog, will you?”The objectionable puppy, whose nose and eyes were equally black and\nexpressive, was thus got rid of, since Miss Brooke decided that it had\nbetter not have been born. But she felt it necessary to explain.“You must not judge of Celia’s feeling from mine. I think she likes\nthese small pets. She had a tiny terrier once, which she was very fond\nof. It made me unhappy, because I was afraid of treading on it. I am\nrather short-sighted.”“You have your own opinion about everything, Miss Brooke, and it is\nalways a good opinion.”What answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?“Do you know, I envy you that,” Sir James said, as they continued\nwalking at the rather brisk pace set by Dorothea.“I don’t quite understand what you mean.”"

One hears very sensible things said on\nopposite sides.”“Or that seem sensible. Perhaps we don’t always discriminate between\nsense and nonsense.”Dorothea felt that she was rather rude.“Exactly,” said Sir James. “But you seem to have the power of\ndiscrimination.”“On the contrary, I am often unable to decide. But that is from\nignorance. The right conclusion is there all the same, though I am\nunable to see it.”“I think there are few who would see it more readily. Do you know,\nLovegood was telling me yesterday that you had the best notion in the\nworld of a plan for cottages—quite wonderful for a young lady, he\nthought. You had a real _genus_, to use his expression. He said you\nwanted Mr. Brooke to build a new set of cottages, but he seemed to\nthink it hardly probable that your uncle would consent. Do you know,\nthat is one of the things I wish to do—I mean, on my own estate. I\nshould be so glad to carry out that plan of yours, if you would let me\nsee it. Of course, it is sinking money; that is why people object to\nit. Laborers can never pay rent to make it answer. But, after all, it\nis worth doing.”“Worth doing! yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, energetically, forgetting\nher previous small vexations. “I think we deserve to be beaten out of\nour beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords—all of us who let\ntenants live in such sties as we see round us. Life in cottages might\nbe happier than ours, if they were real houses fit for human beings\nfrom whom we expect duties and affections.”“Will you show me your plan?”“Yes, certainly. I dare say it is very faulty. But I have been\nexamining all the plans for cottages in Loudon’s book, and picked out\nwhat seem the best things. Oh what a happiness it would be to set the\npattern about here! I think instead of Lazarus at the gate, we should\nput the pigsty cottages outside the park-gate.”"

  "content": "Dorothea was in the best temper now. Sir James, as brother in-law,\nbuilding model cottages on his estate, and then, perhaps, others being\nbuilt at Lowick, and more and more elsewhere in imitation—it would be\nas if the spirit of Oberlin had passed over the parishes to make the\nlife of poverty beautiful!Sir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon with\nLovegood. He also took away a complacent sense that he was making great\nprogress in Miss Brooke’s good opinion. The Maltese puppy was not\noffered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea afterwards thought of with\nsurprise; but she blamed herself for it. She had been engrossing Sir\nJames. After all, it was a relief that there was no puppy to tread\nupon.Celia was present while the plans were being examined, and observed Sir\nJames’s illusion. “He thinks that Dodo cares about him, and she only\ncares about her plans. Yet I am not certain that she would refuse him\nif she thought he would let her manage everything and carry out all her\nnotions. And how very uncomfortable Sir James would be! I cannot bear\nnotions.”It was Celia’s private luxury to indulge in this dislike. She dared not\nconfess it to her sister in any direct statement, for that would be\nlaying herself open to a demonstration that she was somehow or other at\nwar with all goodness. But on safe opportunities, she had an indirect\nmode of making her negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her\ndown from her rhapsodic mood by reminding her that people were staring,\nnot listening. Celia was not impulsive: what she had to say could wait,\nand came from her always with the same quiet staccato evenness. When\npeople talked with energy and emphasis she watched their faces and\nfeatures merely. She never could understand how well-bred persons\nconsented to sing and open their mouths in the ridiculous manner\nrequisite for that vocal exercise."

  "content": "It was not many days before Mr. Casaubon paid a morning visit, on which\nhe was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.\nThus Dorothea had three more conversations with him, and was convinced\nthat her first impressions had been just. He was all she had at first\nimagined him to be: almost everything he had said seemed like a\nspecimen from a mine, or the inscription on the door of a museum which\nmight open on the treasures of past ages; and this trust in his mental\nwealth was all the deeper and more effective on her inclination because\nit was now obvious that his visits were made for her sake. This\naccomplished man condescended to think of a young girl, and take the\npains to talk to her, not with absurd compliment, but with an appeal to\nher understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction. What\ndelightful companionship! Mr. Casaubon seemed even unconscious that\ntrivialities existed, and never handed round that small-talk of heavy\nmen which is as acceptable as stale bride-cake brought forth with an\nodor of cupboard. He talked of what he was interested in, or else he\nwas silent and bowed with sad civility. To Dorothea this was adorable\ngenuineness, and religious abstinence from that artificiality which\nuses up the soul in the efforts of pretence. For she looked as\nreverently at Mr. Casaubon’s religious elevation above herself as she\ndid at his intellect and learning. He assented to her expressions of\ndevout feeling, and usually with an appropriate quotation; he allowed\nhimself to say that he had gone through some spiritual conflicts in his\nyouth; in short, Dorothea saw that here she might reckon on\nunderstanding, sympathy, and guidance. On one—only one—of her favorite\nthemes she was disappointed. Mr. Casaubon apparently did not care about\nbuilding cottages, and diverted the talk to the extremely narrow\naccommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the ancient\nEgyptians, as if to check a too high standard. After he was gone,\nDorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of his; and her\nmind was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying\nconditions of climate which modify human needs, and from the admitted\nwickedness of pagan despots. Should she not urge these arguments on Mr.\nCasaubon when he came again? But further reflection told her that she\nwas presumptuous in demanding his attention to such a subject; he would\nnot disapprove of her occupying herself with it in leisure moments, as\nother women expected to occupy themselves with their dress and\nembroidery—would not forbid it when—Dorothea felt rather ashamed as she\ndetected herself in these speculations. But her uncle had been invited\nto go to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to suppose\nthat Mr. Casaubon delighted in Mr. Brooke’s society for its own sake,\neither with or without documents?"

  "content": "Meanwhile that little disappointment made her delight the more in Sir\nJames Chettam’s readiness to set on foot the desired improvements. He\ncame much oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea ceased to find him\ndisagreeable since he showed himself so entirely in earnest; for he had\nalready entered with much practical ability into Lovegood’s estimates,\nand was charmingly docile. She proposed to build a couple of cottages,\nand transfer two families from their old cabins, which could then be\npulled down, so that new ones could be built on the old sites. Sir\nJames said “Exactly,” and she bore the word remarkably well.Certainly these men who had so few spontaneous ideas might be very\nuseful members of society under good feminine direction, if they were\nfortunate in choosing their sisters-in-law! It is difficult to say\nwhether there was or was not a little wilfulness in her continuing\nblind to the possibility that another sort of choice was in question in\nrelation to her. But her life was just now full of hope and action: she\nwas not only thinking of her plans, but getting down learned books from\nthe library and reading many things hastily (that she might be a little\nless ignorant in talking to Mr. Casaubon), all the while being visited\nwith conscientious questionings whether she were not exalting these\npoor doings above measure and contemplating them with that\nself-satisfaction which was the last doom of ignorance and folly.CHAPTER IV.1_st Gent_. Our deeds are fetters that we forge ourselves.2_d Gent._ Ay, truly: but I think it is the world\nThat brings the iron.“Sir James seems determined to do everything you wish,” said Celia, as\nthey were driving home from an inspection of the new building-site.“He is a good creature, and more sensible than any one would imagine,”\nsaid Dorothea, inconsiderately.“You mean that he appears silly.”“No, no,” said Dorothea, recollecting herself, and laying her hand on\nher sister’s a moment, “but he does not talk equally well on all\nsubjects.”"

  "content": "“I should think none but disagreeable people do,” said Celia, in her\nusual purring way. “They must be very dreadful to live with. Only\nthink! at breakfast, and always.”Dorothea laughed. “O Kitty, you are a wonderful creature!” She pinched\nCelia’s chin, being in the mood now to think her very winning and\nlovely—fit hereafter to be an eternal cherub, and if it were not\ndoctrinally wrong to say so, hardly more in need of salvation than a\nsquirrel. “Of course people need not be always talking well. Only one\ntells the quality of their minds when they try to talk well.”“You mean that Sir James tries and fails.”“I was speaking generally. Why do you catechise me about Sir James? It\nis not the object of his life to please me.”“Now, Dodo, can you really believe that?”“Certainly. He thinks of me as a future sister—that is all.” Dorothea\nhad never hinted this before, waiting, from a certain shyness on such\nsubjects which was mutual between the sisters, until it should be\nintroduced by some decisive event. Celia blushed, but said at once—“Pray do not make that mistake any longer, Dodo. When Tantripp was\nbrushing my hair the other day, she said that Sir James’s man knew from\nMrs. Cadwallader’s maid that Sir James was to marry the eldest Miss\nBrooke.”“How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you, Celia?” said\nDorothea, indignantly, not the less angry because details asleep in her\nmemory were now awakened to confirm the unwelcome revelation. “You must\nhave asked her questions. It is degrading.”“I see no harm at all in Tantripp’s talking to me. It is better to hear\nwhat people say. You see what mistakes you make by taking up notions. I\nam quite sure that Sir James means to make you an offer; and he\nbelieves that you will accept him, especially since you have been so\npleased with him about the plans. And uncle too—I know he expects it.\nEvery one can see that Sir James is very much in love with you.”"

All her dear plans were\nembittered, and she thought with disgust of Sir James’s conceiving that\nshe recognized him as her lover. There was vexation too on account of\nCelia.“How could he expect it?” she burst forth in her most impetuous manner.\n“I have never agreed with him about anything but the cottages: I was\nbarely polite to him before.”“But you have been so pleased with him since then; he has begun to feel\nquite sure that you are fond of him.”“Fond of him, Celia! How can you choose such odious expressions?” said\nDorothea, passionately.“Dear me, Dorothea, I suppose it would be right for you to be fond of a\nman whom you accepted for a husband.”“It is offensive to me to say that Sir James could think I was fond of\nhim. Besides, it is not the right word for the feeling I must have\ntowards the man I would accept as a husband.”“Well, I am sorry for Sir James. I thought it right to tell you,\nbecause you went on as you always do, never looking just where you are,\nand treading in the wrong place. You always see what nobody else sees;\nit is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what is quite plain.\nThat’s your way, Dodo.” Something certainly gave Celia unusual courage;\nand she was not sparing the sister of whom she was occasionally in awe.\nWho can tell what just criticisms Murr the Cat may be passing on us\nbeings of wider speculation?“It is very painful,” said Dorothea, feeling scourged. “I can have no\nmore to do with the cottages. I must be uncivil to him. I must tell him\nI will have nothing to do with them. It is very painful.” Her eyes\nfilled again with tears.“Wait a little. Think about it. You know he is going away for a day or\ntwo to see his sister. There will be nobody besides Lovegood.” Celia\ncould not help relenting. “Poor Dodo,” she went on, in an amiable\nstaccato. “It is very hard: it is your favorite _fad_ to draw plans.”“_Fad_ to draw plans! Do you think I only care about my\nfellow-creatures’ houses in that childish way? I may well make\nmistakes. How can one ever do anything nobly Christian, living among\npeople with such petty thoughts?”"

She\nwas disposed rather to accuse the intolerable narrowness and the\npurblind conscience of the society around her: and Celia was no longer\nthe eternal cherub, but a thorn in her spirit, a pink-and-white\nnullifidian, worse than any discouraging presence in the “Pilgrim’s\nProgress.” The _fad_ of drawing plans! What was life worth—what great\nfaith was possible when the whole effect of one’s actions could be\nwithered up into such parched rubbish as that? When she got out of the\ncarriage, her cheeks were pale and her eyelids red. She was an image of\nsorrow, and her uncle who met her in the hall would have been alarmed,\nif Celia had not been close to her looking so pretty and composed, that\nhe at once concluded Dorothea’s tears to have their origin in her\nexcessive religiousness. He had returned, during their absence, from a\njourney to the county town, about a petition for the pardon of some\ncriminal.“Well, my dears,” he said, kindly, as they went up to kiss him, “I hope\nnothing disagreeable has happened while I have been away.”“No, uncle,” said Celia, “we have been to Freshitt to look at the\ncottages. We thought you would have been at home to lunch.”“I came by Lowick to lunch—you didn’t know I came by Lowick. And I have\nbrought a couple of pamphlets for you, Dorothea—in the library, you\nknow; they lie on the table in the library.”It seemed as if an electric stream went through Dorothea, thrilling her\nfrom despair into expectation. They were pamphlets about the early\nChurch. The oppression of Celia, Tantripp, and Sir James was shaken\noff, and she walked straight to the library. Celia went up-stairs. Mr.\nBrooke was detained by a message, but when he re-entered the library,\nhe found Dorothea seated and already deep in one of the pamphlets which\nhad some marginal manuscript of Mr. Casaubon’s,—taking it in as eagerly\nas she might have taken in the scent of a fresh bouquet after a dry,\nhot, dreary walk.She was getting away from Tipton and Freshitt, and her own sad\nliability to tread in the wrong places on her way to the New Jerusalem.Mr. Brooke sat down in his arm-chair, stretched his legs towards the\nwood-fire, which had fallen into a wondrous mass of glowing dice\nbetween the dogs, and rubbed his hands gently, looking very mildly\ntowards Dorothea, but with a neutral leisurely air, as if he had\nnothing particular to say. Dorothea closed her pamphlet, as soon as she\nwas aware of her uncle’s presence, and rose as if to go. Usually she\nwould have been interested about her uncle’s merciful errand on behalf\nof the criminal, but her late agitation had made her absent-minded."

This fundamental principle of\nhuman speech was markedly exhibited in Mr. Brooke. “I lunched there and\nsaw Casaubon’s library, and that kind of thing. There’s a sharp air,\ndriving. Won’t you sit down, my dear? You look cold.”Dorothea felt quite inclined to accept the invitation. Some times, when\nher uncle’s easy way of taking things did not happen to be\nexasperating, it was rather soothing. She threw off her mantle and\nbonnet, and sat down opposite to him, enjoying the glow, but lifting up\nher beautiful hands for a screen. They were not thin hands, or small\nhands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands. She seemed to be holding\nthem up in propitiation for her passionate desire to know and to think,\nwhich in the unfriendly mediums of Tipton and Freshitt had issued in\ncrying and red eyelids.She bethought herself now of the condemned criminal. “What news have\nyou brought about the sheep-stealer, uncle?”“What, poor Bunch?—well, it seems we can’t get him off—he is to be\nhanged.”Dorothea’s brow took an expression of reprobation and pity.“Hanged, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with a quiet nod. “Poor Romilly!\nhe would have helped us. I knew Romilly. Casaubon didn’t know Romilly.\nHe is a little buried in books, you know, Casaubon is.”“When a man has great studies and is writing a great work, he must of\ncourse give up seeing much of the world. How can he go about making\nacquaintances?”“That’s true. But a man mopes, you know. I have always been a bachelor\ntoo, but I have that sort of disposition that I never moped; it was my\nway to go about everywhere and take in everything. I never moped: but I\ncan see that Casaubon does, you know. He wants a companion—a companion,\nyou know.”“It would be a great honor to any one to be his companion,” said\nDorothea, energetically.“You like him, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, without showing any surprise, or\nother emotion. “Well, now, I’ve known Casaubon ten years, ever since he\ncame to Lowick. But I never got anything out of him—any ideas, you\nknow. However, he is a tiptop man and may be a bishop—that kind of\nthing, you know, if Peel stays in.

But I didn’t\nthink it necessary to go into everything. However, the long and the\nshort of it is, that he has asked my permission to make you an offer of\nmarriage—of marriage, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with his explanatory\nnod. “I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”No one could have detected any anxiety in Mr. Brooke’s manner, but he\ndid really wish to know something of his niece’s mind, that, if there\nwere any need for advice, he might give it in time. What feeling he, as\na magistrate who had taken in so many ideas, could make room for, was\nunmixedly kind. Since Dorothea did not speak immediately, he repeated,\n“I thought it better to tell you, my dear.”“Thank you, uncle,” said Dorothea, in a clear unwavering tone. “I am\nvery grateful to Mr. Casaubon. If he makes me an offer, I shall accept\nhim. I admire and honor him more than any man I ever saw.”Mr. Brooke paused a little, and then said in a lingering low tone, “Ah?\n… Well! He is a good match in some respects. But now, Chettam is a good\nmatch. And our land lies together. I shall never interfere against your\nwishes, my dear. People should have their own way in marriage, and that\nsort of thing—up to a certain point, you know. I have always said that,\nup to a certain point. I wish you to marry well; and I have good reason\nto believe that Chettam wishes to marry you. I mention it, you know.”“It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam,” said\nDorothea. “If he thinks of marrying me, he has made a great mistake.”“That is it, you see. One never knows. I should have thought Chettam\nwas just the sort of man a woman would like, now.”“Pray do not mention him in that light again, uncle,” said Dorothea,\nfeeling some of her late irritation revive.Mr. Brooke wondered, and felt that women were an inexhaustible subject\nof study, since even he at his age was not in a perfect state of\nscientific prediction about them.

I thought you liked your own opinion—liked\nit, you know.”“I cannot imagine myself living without some opinions, but I should\nwish to have good reasons for them, and a wise man could help me to see\nwhich opinions had the best foundation, and would help me to live\naccording to them.”“Very true. You couldn’t put the thing better—couldn’t put it better,\nbeforehand, you know. But there are oddities in things,” continued Mr.\nBrooke, whose conscience was really roused to do the best he could for\nhis niece on this occasion. “Life isn’t cast in a mould—not cut out by\nrule and line, and that sort of thing. I never married myself, and it\nwill be the better for you and yours. The fact is, I never loved any\none well enough to put myself into a noose for them. It _is_ a noose,\nyou know. Temper, now. There is temper. And a husband likes to be\nmaster.”“I know that I must expect trials, uncle. Marriage is a state of higher\nduties. I never thought of it as mere personal ease,” said poor\nDorothea.“Well, you are not fond of show, a great establishment, balls, dinners,\nthat kind of thing. I can see that Casaubon’s ways might suit you\nbetter than Chettam’s. And you shall do as you like, my dear. I would\nnot hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is no knowing how\nanything may turn out. You have not the same tastes as every young\nlady; and a clergyman and scholar—who may be a bishop—that kind of\nthing—may suit you better than Chettam. Chettam is a good fellow, a\ngood sound-hearted fellow, you know; but he doesn’t go much into ideas.\nI did, when I was his age. But Casaubon’s eyes, now. I think he has\nhurt them a little with too much reading.”"

Well, my dear, the fact is, I\nhave a letter for you in my pocket.” Mr. Brooke handed the letter to\nDorothea, but as she rose to go away, he added, “There is not too much\nhurry, my dear. Think about it, you know.”When Dorothea had left him, he reflected that he had certainly spoken\nstrongly: he had put the risks of marriage before her in a striking\nmanner. It was his duty to do so. But as to pretending to be wise for\nyoung people,—no uncle, however much he had travelled in his youth,\nabsorbed the new ideas, and dined with celebrities now deceased, could\npretend to judge what sort of marriage would turn out well for a young\ngirl who preferred Casaubon to Chettam. In short, woman was a problem\nwhich, since Mr. Brooke’s mind felt blank before it, could be hardly\nless complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.CHAPTER V.“Hard students are commonly troubled with gowts, catarrhs, rheums,\ncachexia, bradypepsia, bad eyes, stone, and collick, crudities,\noppilations, vertigo, winds, consumptions, and all such diseases as\ncome by over-much sitting: they are most part lean, dry, ill-colored …\nand all through immoderate pains and extraordinary studies.

I am not, I trust,\nmistaken in the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of\ndate in the fact that a consciousness of need in my own life had arisen\ncontemporaneously with the possibility of my becoming acquainted with\nyou. For in the first hour of meeting you, I had an impression of your\neminent and perhaps exclusive fitness to supply that need (connected, I\nmay say, with such activity of the affections as even the\npreoccupations of a work too special to be abdicated could not\nuninterruptedly dissimulate); and each succeeding opportunity for\nobservation has given the impression an added depth by convincing me\nmore emphatically of that fitness which I had preconceived, and thus\nevoking more decisively those affections to which I have but now\nreferred. Our conversations have, I think, made sufficiently clear to\nyou the tenor of my life and purposes: a tenor unsuited, I am aware, to\nthe commoner order of minds. But I have discerned in you an elevation\nof thought and a capability of devotedness, which I had hitherto not\nconceived to be compatible either with the early bloom of youth or with\nthose graces of sex that may be said at once to win and to confer\ndistinction when combined, as they notably are in you, with the mental\nqualities above indicated. It was, I confess, beyond my hope to meet\nwith this rare combination of elements both solid and attractive,\nadapted to supply aid in graver labors and to cast a charm over vacant\nhours; and but for the event of my introduction to you (which, let me\nagain say, I trust not to be superficially coincident with\nforeshadowing needs, but providentially related thereto as stages\ntowards the completion of a life’s plan), I should presumably have gone\non to the last without any attempt to lighten my solitariness by a\nmatrimonial union.\n    Such, my dear Miss Brooke, is the accurate statement of my\n    feelings; and I rely on your kind indulgence in venturing now to\n    ask you how far your own are of a nature to confirm my happy\n    presentiment. To be accepted by you as your husband and the earthly\n    guardian of your welfare, I should regard as the highest of\n    providential gifts. In return I can at least offer you an affection\n    hitherto unwasted, and the faithful consecration of a life which,\n    however short in the sequel, has no backward pages whereon, if you\n    choose to turn them, you will find records such as might justly\n    cause you either bitterness or shame. I await the expression of\n    your sentiments with an anxiety which it would be the part of\n    wisdom (were it possible) to divert by a more arduous labor than\n    usual. But in this order of experience I am still young, and in\n    looking forward to an unfavorable possibility I cannot but feel\n    that resignation to solitude will be more difficult after the\n    temporary illumination of hope."

She could not pray: under the rush\nof solemn emotion in which thoughts became vague and images floated\nuncertainly, she could but cast herself, with a childlike sense of\nreclining, in the lap of a divine consciousness which sustained her\nown. She remained in that attitude till it was time to dress for\ndinner.How could it occur to her to examine the letter, to look at it\ncritically as a profession of love? Her whole soul was possessed by the\nfact that a fuller life was opening before her: she was a neophyte\nabout to enter on a higher grade of initiation. She was going to have\nroom for the energies which stirred uneasily under the dimness and\npressure of her own ignorance and the petty peremptoriness of the\nworld’s habits.Now she would be able to devote herself to large yet definite duties;\nnow she would be allowed to live continually in the light of a mind\nthat she could reverence. This hope was not unmixed with the glow of\nproud delight—the joyous maiden surprise that she was chosen by the man\nwhom her admiration had chosen. All Dorothea’s passion was transfused\nthrough a mind struggling towards an ideal life; the radiance of her\ntransfigured girlhood fell on the first object that came within its\nlevel. The impetus with which inclination became resolution was\nheightened by those little events of the day which had roused her\ndiscontent with the actual conditions of her life."

Why should she defer the answer? She wrote it over\nthree times, not because she wished to change the wording, but because\nher hand was unusually uncertain, and she could not bear that Mr.\nCasaubon should think her handwriting bad and illegible. She piqued\nherself on writing a hand in which each letter was distinguishable\nwithout any large range of conjecture, and she meant to make much use\nof this accomplishment, to save Mr. Casaubon’s eyes. Three times she\nwrote.MY DEAR MR. CASAUBON,—I am very grateful to you for loving me, and\nthinking me worthy to be your wife. I can look forward to no better\nhappiness than that which would be one with yours. If I said more, it\nwould only be the same thing written out at greater length, for I\ncannot now dwell on any other thought than that I may be through lifeYours devotedly,\n    DOROTHEA BROOKE.Later in the evening she followed her uncle into the library to give\nhim the letter, that he might send it in the morning. He was surprised,\nbut his surprise only issued in a few moments’ silence, during which he\npushed about various objects on his writing-table, and finally stood\nwith his back to the fire, his glasses on his nose, looking at the\naddress of Dorothea’s letter.“Have you thought enough about this, my dear?” he said at last.“There was no need to think long, uncle. I know of nothing to make me\nvacillate. If I changed my mind, it must be because of something\nimportant and entirely new to me.”“Ah!—then you have accepted him? Then Chettam has no chance? Has\nChettam offended you—offended you, you know? What is it you don’t like\nin Chettam?”“There is nothing that I like in him,” said Dorothea, rather\nimpetuously.Mr. Brooke threw his head and shoulders backward as if some one had\nthrown a light missile at him. Dorothea immediately felt some\nself-rebuke, and said—“I mean in the light of a husband. He is very kind, I think—really very\ngood about the cottages. A well-meaning man.”"

I had it myself—that love of knowledge, and going\ninto everything—a little too much—it took me too far; though that sort\nof thing doesn’t often run in the female-line; or it runs underground\nlike the rivers in Greece, you know—it comes out in the sons. Clever\nsons, clever mothers. I went a good deal into that, at one time.\nHowever, my dear, I have always said that people should do as they like\nin these things, up to a certain point. I couldn’t, as your guardian,\nhave consented to a bad match. But Casaubon stands well: his position\nis good. I am afraid Chettam will be hurt, though, and Mrs. Cadwallader\nwill blame me.”That evening, of course, Celia knew nothing of what had happened. She\nattributed Dorothea’s abstracted manner, and the evidence of further\ncrying since they had got home, to the temper she had been in about Sir\nJames Chettam and the buildings, and was careful not to give further\noffence: having once said what she wanted to say, Celia had no\ndisposition to recur to disagreeable subjects. It had been her nature\nwhen a child never to quarrel with any one—only to observe with wonder\nthat they quarrelled with her, and looked like turkey-cocks; whereupon\nshe was ready to play at cat’s cradle with them whenever they recovered\nthemselves. And as to Dorothea, it had always been her way to find\nsomething wrong in her sister’s words, though Celia inwardly protested\nthat she always said just how things were, and nothing else: she never\ndid and never could put words together out of her own head. But the\nbest of Dodo was, that she did not keep angry for long together. Now,\nthough they had hardly spoken to each other all the evening, yet when\nCelia put by her work, intending to go to bed, a proceeding in which\nshe was always much the earlier, Dorothea, who was seated on a low\nstool, unable to occupy herself except in meditation, said, with the\nmusical intonation which in moments of deep but quiet feeling made her\nspeech like a fine bit of recitative—“Celia, dear, come and kiss me,” holding her arms open as she spoke.Celia knelt down to get the right level and gave her little butterfly\nkiss, while Dorothea encircled her with gentle arms and pressed her\nlips gravely on each cheek in turn.“Don’t sit up, Dodo, you are so pale to-night: go to bed soon,” said\nCelia, in a comfortable way, without any touch of pathos.“No, dear, I am very, very happy,” said Dorothea, fervently.“So much the better,” thought Celia. “But how strangely Dodo goes from\none extreme to the other.”"

It seemed as if something like the\nreflection of a white sunlit wing had passed across her features,\nending in one of her rare blushes. For the first time it entered into\nCelia’s mind that there might be something more between Mr. Casaubon\nand her sister than his delight in bookish talk and her delight in\nlistening. Hitherto she had classed the admiration for this “ugly” and\nlearned acquaintance with the admiration for Monsieur Liret at\nLausanne, also ugly and learned. Dorothea had never been tired of\nlistening to old Monsieur Liret when Celia’s feet were as cold as\npossible, and when it had really become dreadful to see the skin of his\nbald head moving about. Why then should her enthusiasm not extend to\nMr. Casaubon simply in the same way as to Monsieur Liret? And it seemed\nprobable that all learned men had a sort of schoolmaster’s view of\nyoung people."

  "content": "But now Celia was really startled at the suspicion which had darted\ninto her mind. She was seldom taken by surprise in this way, her\nmarvellous quickness in observing a certain order of signs generally\npreparing her to expect such outward events as she had an interest in.\nNot that she now imagined Mr. Casaubon to be already an accepted lover:\nshe had only begun to feel disgust at the possibility that anything in\nDorothea’s mind could tend towards such an issue. Here was something\nreally to vex her about Dodo: it was all very well not to accept Sir\nJames Chettam, but the idea of marrying Mr. Casaubon! Celia felt a sort\nof shame mingled with a sense of the ludicrous. But perhaps Dodo, if\nshe were really bordering on such an extravagance, might be turned away\nfrom it: experience had often shown that her impressibility might be\ncalculated on. The day was damp, and they were not going to walk out,\nso they both went up to their sitting-room; and there Celia observed\nthat Dorothea, instead of settling down with her usual diligent\ninterest to some occupation, simply leaned her elbow on an open book\nand looked out of the window at the great cedar silvered with the damp.\nShe herself had taken up the making of a toy for the curate’s children,\nand was not going to enter on any subject too precipitately.Dorothea was in fact thinking that it was desirable for Celia to know\nof the momentous change in Mr. Casaubon’s position since he had last\nbeen in the house: it did not seem fair to leave her in ignorance of\nwhat would necessarily affect her attitude towards him; but it was\nimpossible not to shrink from telling her. Dorothea accused herself of\nsome meanness in this timidity: it was always odious to her to have any\nsmall fears or contrivances about her actions, but at this moment she\nwas seeking the highest aid possible that she might not dread the\ncorrosiveness of Celia’s pretty carnally minded prose. Her reverie was\nbroken, and the difficulty of decision banished, by Celia’s small and\nrather guttural voice speaking in its usual tone, of a remark aside or\na “by the bye.”“Is any one else coming to dine besides Mr. Casaubon?”“Not that I know of.”“I hope there is some one else. Then I shall not hear him eat his soup\nso.”“What is there remarkable about his soup-eating?”“Really, Dodo, can’t you hear how he scrapes his spoon? And he always\nblinks before he speaks. I don’t know whether Locke blinked, but I’m\nsure I am sorry for those who sat opposite to him if he did.”“Celia,” said Dorothea, with emphatic gravity, “pray don’t make any\nmore observations of that kind.”“Why not? They are quite true,” returned Celia, who had her reasons for\npersevering, though she was beginning to be a little afraid.“Many things are true which only the commonest minds observe.”“Then I think the commonest minds must be rather useful. I think it is\na pity Mr. Casaubon’s mother had not a commoner mind: she might have\ntaught him better.” Celia was inwardly frightened, and ready to run\naway, now she had hurled this light javelin.Dorothea’s feelings had gathered to an avalanche, and there could be no\nfurther preparation.“It is right to tell you, Celia, that I am engaged to marry Mr.\nCasaubon.”"

She laid the fragile figure down at\nonce, and sat perfectly still for a few moments. When she spoke there\nwas a tear gathering.“Oh, Dodo, I hope you will be happy.” Her sisterly tenderness could not\nbut surmount other feelings at this moment, and her fears were the\nfears of affection.Dorothea was still hurt and agitated.“It is quite decided, then?” said Celia, in an awed under tone. “And\nuncle knows?”“I have accepted Mr. Casaubon’s offer. My uncle brought me the letter\nthat contained it; he knew about it beforehand.”“I beg your pardon, if I have said anything to hurt you, Dodo,” said\nCelia, with a slight sob. She never could have thought that she should\nfeel as she did. There was something funereal in the whole affair, and\nMr. Casaubon seemed to be the officiating clergyman, about whom it\nwould be indecent to make remarks.“Never mind, Kitty, do not grieve. We should never admire the same\npeople. I often offend in something of the same way; I am apt to speak\ntoo strongly of those who don’t please me.”In spite of this magnanimity Dorothea was still smarting: perhaps as\nmuch from Celia’s subdued astonishment as from her small criticisms. Of\ncourse all the world round Tipton would be out of sympathy with this\nmarriage. Dorothea knew of no one who thought as she did about life and\nits best objects.Nevertheless before the evening was at an end she was very happy. In an\nhour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mr. Casaubon she talked to him with more\nfreedom than she had ever felt before, even pouring out her joy at the\nthought of devoting herself to him, and of learning how she might best\nshare and further all his great ends. Mr. Casaubon was touched with an\nunknown delight (what man would not have been?) at this childlike\nunrestrained ardor: he was not surprised (what lover would have been?)\nthat he should be the object of it."
