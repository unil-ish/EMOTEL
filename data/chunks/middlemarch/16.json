  "content": "Should he apply directly to Mr. Brooke, and demand of that troublesome\ngentleman to revoke his proposal? Or should he consult Sir James\nChettam, and get him to concur in remonstrance against a step which\ntouched the whole family? In either case Mr. Casaubon was aware that\nfailure was just as probable as success. It was impossible for him to\nmention Dorothea’s name in the matter, and without some alarming\nurgency Mr. Brooke was as likely as not, after meeting all\nrepresentations with apparent assent, to wind up by saying, “Never\nfear, Casaubon! Depend upon it, young Ladislaw will do you credit.\nDepend upon it, I have put my finger on the right thing.” And Mr.\nCasaubon shrank nervously from communicating on the subject with Sir\nJames Chettam, between whom and himself there had never been any\ncordiality, and who would immediately think of Dorothea without any\nmention of her.Poor Mr. Casaubon was distrustful of everybody’s feeling towards him,\nespecially as a husband. To let any one suppose that he was jealous\nwould be to admit their (suspected) view of his disadvantages: to let\nthem know that he did not find marriage particularly blissful would\nimply his conversion to their (probably) earlier disapproval. It would\nbe as bad as letting Carp, and Brasenose generally, know how backward\nhe was in organizing the matter for his “Key to all Mythologies.” All\nthrough his life Mr. Casaubon had been trying not to admit even to\nhimself the inward sores of self-doubt and jealousy. And on the most\ndelicate of all personal subjects, the habit of proud suspicious\nreticence told doubly.Thus Mr. Casaubon remained proudly, bitterly silent. But he had\nforbidden Will to come to Lowick Manor, and he was mentally preparing\nother measures of frustration.CHAPTER XXXVIII.“C’est beaucoup que le jugement des hommes sur les actions humaines;\ntôt ou tard il devient efficace.”—GUIZOT.Sir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on Mr. Brooke’s\nnew courses; but it was easier to object than to hinder. Sir James\naccounted for his having come in alone one day to lunch with the\nCadwalladers by saying—“I can’t talk to you as I want, before Celia: it might hurt her.\nIndeed, it would not be right.”“I know what you mean—the ‘Pioneer’ at the Grange!” darted in Mrs.\nCadwallader, almost before the last word was off her friend’s tongue.\n“It is frightful—this taking to buying whistles and blowing them in\neverybody’s hearing. Lying in bed all day and playing at dominoes, like\npoor Lord Plessy, would be more private and bearable.”“I see they are beginning to attack our friend Brooke in the\n‘Trumpet,’” said the Rector, lounging back and smiling easily, as he\nwould have done if he had been attacked himself. “There are tremendous\nsarcasms against a landlord not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who\nreceives his own rents, and makes no returns.”"

  "content": "“I do wish Brooke would leave that off,” said Sir James, with his\nlittle frown of annoyance.“Is he really going to be put in nomination, though?” said Mr.\nCadwallader. “I saw Farebrother yesterday—he’s Whiggish himself, hoists\nBrougham and Useful Knowledge; that’s the worst I know of him;—and he\nsays that Brooke is getting up a pretty strong party. Bulstrode, the\nbanker, is his foremost man. But he thinks Brooke would come off badly\nat a nomination.”“Exactly,” said Sir James, with earnestness. “I have been inquiring\ninto the thing, for I’ve never known anything about Middlemarch\npolitics before—the county being my business. What Brooke trusts to, is\nthat they are going to turn out Oliver because he is a Peelite. But\nHawley tells me that if they send up a Whig at all it is sure to be\nBagster, one of those candidates who come from heaven knows where, but\ndead against Ministers, and an experienced Parliamentary man. Hawley’s\nrather rough: he forgot that he was speaking to me. He said if Brooke\nwanted a pelting, he could get it cheaper than by going to the\nhustings.”“I warned you all of it,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her hands\noutward. “I said to Humphrey long ago, Mr. Brooke is going to make a\nsplash in the mud. And now he has done it.”“Well, he might have taken it into his head to marry,” said the Rector.\n“That would have been a graver mess than a little flirtation with\npolitics.”“He may do that afterwards,” said Mrs. Cadwallader—“when he has come\nout on the other side of the mud with an ague.”“What I care for most is his own dignity,” said Sir James. “Of course I\ncare the more because of the family. But he’s getting on in life now,\nand I don’t like to think of his exposing himself. They will be raking\nup everything against him.”“I suppose it’s no use trying any persuasion,” said the Rector.\n“There’s such an odd mixture of obstinacy and changeableness in Brooke.\nHave you tried him on the subject?”"

  "content": "“Well, no,” said Sir James; “I feel a delicacy in appearing to dictate.\nBut I have been talking to this young Ladislaw that Brooke is making a\nfactotum of. Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything. I thought it as\nwell to hear what he had to say; and he is against Brooke’s standing\nthis time. I think he’ll turn him round: I think the nomination may be\nstaved off.”“I know,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, nodding. “The independent member\nhasn’t got his speeches well enough by heart.”“But this Ladislaw—there again is a vexatious business,” said Sir\nJames. “We have had him two or three times to dine at the Hall (you\nhave met him, by the bye) as Brooke’s guest and a relation of\nCasaubon’s, thinking he was only on a flying visit. And now I find he’s\nin everybody’s mouth in Middlemarch as the editor of the ‘Pioneer.’\nThere are stories going about him as a quill-driving alien, a foreign\nemissary, and what not.”“Casaubon won’t like that,” said the Rector.“There _is_ some foreign blood in Ladislaw,” returned Sir James. “I\nhope he won’t go into extreme opinions and carry Brooke on.”“Oh, he’s a dangerous young sprig, that Mr. Ladislaw,” said Mrs.\nCadwallader, “with his opera songs and his ready tongue. A sort of\nByronic hero—an amorous conspirator, it strikes me. And Thomas Aquinas\nis not fond of him. I could see that, the day the picture was brought.”“I don’t like to begin on the subject with Casaubon,” said Sir James.\n“He has more right to interfere than I. But it’s a disagreeable affair\nall round. What a character for anybody with decent connections to show\nhimself in!—one of those newspaper fellows! You have only to look at\nKeck, who manages the ‘Trumpet.’ I saw him the other day with Hawley.\nHis writing is sound enough, I believe, but he’s such a low fellow,\nthat I wished he had been on the wrong side.”“What can you expect with these peddling Middlemarch papers?” said the\nRector. “I don’t suppose you could get a high style of man anywhere to\nbe writing up interests he doesn’t really care about, and for pay that\nhardly keeps him in at elbows.”“Exactly: that makes it so annoying that Brooke should have put a man\nwho has a sort of connection with the family in a position of that\nkind. For my part, I think Ladislaw is rather a fool for accepting.”"

  "content": "“It is Aquinas’s fault,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “Why didn’t he use his\ninterest to get Ladislaw made an _attache_ or sent to India? That is\nhow families get rid of troublesome sprigs.”“There is no knowing to what lengths the mischief may go,” said Sir\nJames, anxiously. “But if Casaubon says nothing, what can I do?”“Oh my dear Sir James,” said the Rector, “don’t let us make too much of\nall this. It is likely enough to end in mere smoke. After a month or\ntwo Brooke and this Master Ladislaw will get tired of each other;\nLadislaw will take wing; Brooke will sell the ‘Pioneer,’ and everything\nwill settle down again as usual.”“There is one good chance—that he will not like to feel his money\noozing away,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “If I knew the items of election\nexpenses I could scare him. It’s no use plying him with wide words like\nExpenditure: I wouldn’t talk of phlebotomy, I would empty a pot of\nleeches upon him. What we good stingy people don’t like, is having our\nsixpences sucked away from us.”“And he will not like having things raked up against him,” said Sir\nJames. “There is the management of his estate. They have begun upon\nthat already. And it really is painful for me to see. It is a nuisance\nunder one’s very nose. I do think one is bound to do the best for one’s\nland and tenants, especially in these hard times.”“Perhaps the ‘Trumpet’ may rouse him to make a change, and some good\nmay come of it all,” said the Rector. “I know I should be glad. I\nshould hear less grumbling when my tithe is paid. I don’t know what I\nshould do if there were not a modus in Tipton.”“I want him to have a proper man to look after things—I want him to\ntake on Garth again,” said Sir James. “He got rid of Garth twelve years\nago, and everything has been going wrong since. I think of getting\nGarth to manage for me—he has made such a capital plan for my\nbuildings; and Lovegood is hardly up to the mark. But Garth would not\nundertake the Tipton estate again unless Brooke left it entirely to\nhim.”"

  "content": "“In the right of it too,” said the Rector. “Garth is an independent\nfellow: an original, simple-minded fellow. One day, when he was doing\nsome valuation for me, he told me point-blank that clergymen seldom\nunderstood anything about business, and did mischief when they meddled;\nbut he said it as quietly and respectfully as if he had been talking to\nme about sailors. He would make a different parish of Tipton, if Brooke\nwould let him manage. I wish, by the help of the ‘Trumpet,’ you could\nbring that round.”“If Dorothea had kept near her uncle, there would have been some\nchance,” said Sir James. “She might have got some power over him in\ntime, and she was always uneasy about the estate. She had wonderfully\ngood notions about such things. But now Casaubon takes her up entirely.\nCelia complains a good deal. We can hardly get her to dine with us,\nsince he had that fit.” Sir James ended with a look of pitying disgust,\nand Mrs. Cadwallader shrugged her shoulders as much as to say that\n_she_ was not likely to see anything new in that direction.“Poor Casaubon!” the Rector said. “That was a nasty attack. I thought\nhe looked shattered the other day at the Archdeacon’s.”“In point of fact,” resumed Sir James, not choosing to dwell on “fits,”\n“Brooke doesn’t mean badly by his tenants or any one else, but he has\ngot that way of paring and clipping at expenses.”“Come, that’s a blessing,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “That helps him to\nfind himself in a morning. He may not know his own opinions, but he\ndoes know his own pocket.”“I don’t believe a man is in pocket by stinginess on his land,” said\nSir James.“Oh, stinginess may be abused like other virtues: it will not do to\nkeep one’s own pigs lean,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had risen to look\nout of the window. “But talk of an independent politician and he will\nappear.”“What! Brooke?” said her husband.“Yes. Now, you ply him with the ‘Trumpet,’ Humphrey; and I will put the\nleeches on him. What will you do, Sir James?”“The fact is, I don’t like to begin about it with Brooke, in our mutual\nposition; the whole thing is so unpleasant. I do wish people would\nbehave like gentlemen,” said the good baronet, feeling that this was a\nsimple and comprehensive programme for social well-being."

Well, what do you think of\nthings?—going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte\nsaid—‘Since yesterday, a century has passed away:’—they’re in the next\ncentury, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on faster than\nwe are.”“Why, yes,” said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. “Here is the\n‘Trumpet’ accusing you of lagging behind—did you see?”“Eh? no,” said Mr. Brooke, dropping his gloves into his hat and hastily\nadjusting his eye-glass. But Mr. Cadwallader kept the paper in his\nhand, saying, with a smile in his eyes—“Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles from\nMiddlemarch, who receives his own rents. They say he is the most\nretrogressive man in the county. I think you must have taught them that\nword in the ‘Pioneer.’”“Oh, that is Keck—an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive, now!\nCome, that’s capital. He thinks it means destructive: they want to make\nme out a destructive, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with that\ncheerfulness which is usually sustained by an adversary’s ignorance."

  "content": "“I think he knows the meaning of the word. Here is a sharp stroke or\ntwo. _If we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil\nsense of the word—we should say, he is one who would dub himself a\nreformer of our constitution, while every interest for which he is\nimmediately responsible is going to decay: a philanthropist who cannot\nbear one rogue to be hanged, but does not mind five honest tenants\nbeing half-starved: a man who shrieks at corruption, and keeps his\nfarms at rack-rent: who roars himself red at rotten boroughs, and does\nnot mind if every field on his farms has a rotten gate: a man very\nopen-hearted to Leeds and Manchester, no doubt; he would give any\nnumber of representatives who will pay for their seats out of their own\npockets: what he objects to giving, is a little return on rent-days to\nhelp a tenant to buy stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather\nout at a tenant’s barn-door or make his house look a little less like\nan Irish cottier’s. But we all know the wag’s definition of a\nphilanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the square of\nthe distance._ And so on. All the rest is to show what sort of\nlegislator a philanthropist is likely to make,” ended the Rector,\nthrowing down the paper, and clasping his hands at the back of his\nhead, while he looked at Mr. Brooke with an air of amused neutrality.“Come, that’s rather good, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the\npaper and trying to bear the attack as easily as his neighbor did, but\ncoloring and smiling rather nervously; “that about roaring himself red\nat rotten boroughs—I never made a speech about rotten boroughs in my\nlife. And as to roaring myself red and that kind of thing—these men\nnever understand what is good satire. Satire, you know, should be true\nup to a certain point. I recollect they said that in ‘The Edinburgh’\nsomewhere—it must be true up to a certain point.”“Well, that is really a hit about the gates,” said Sir James, anxious\nto tread carefully. “Dagley complained to me the other day that he\nhadn’t got a decent gate on his farm. Garth has invented a new pattern\nof gate—I wish you would try it. One ought to use some of one’s timber\nin that way.”“You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke,\nappearing to glance over the columns of the “Trumpet.” “That’s your\nhobby, and you don’t mind the expense.”“I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing for\nParliament,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “They said the last unsuccessful\ncandidate at Middlemarch—Giles, wasn’t his name?—spent ten thousand\npounds and failed because he did not bribe enough. What a bitter\nreflection for a man!”“Somebody was saying,” said the Rector, laughingly, “that East Retford\nwas nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery.”“Nothing of the kind,” said Mr. Brooke. “The Tories bribe, you know:\nHawley and his set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and that sort of\nthing; and they bring the voters drunk to the poll. But they are not\ngoing to have it their own way in future—not in future, you know.\nMiddlemarch is a little backward, I admit—the freemen are a little\nbackward. But we shall educate them—we shall bring them on, you know.\nThe best people there are on our side.”“Hawley says you have men on your side who will do you harm,” remarked\nSir James. “He says Bulstrode the banker will do you harm.”"

Good heavens!\nThink what it must be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And I seem to\nremember a story of a man they pretended to chair and let him fall into\na dust-heap on purpose!”“Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one’s coat,” said the\nRector. “I confess that’s what I should be afraid of, if we parsons had\nto stand at the hustings for preferment. I should be afraid of their\nreckoning up all my fishing days. Upon my word, I think the truth is\nthe hardest missile one can be pelted with.”“The fact is,” said Sir James, “if a man goes into public life he must\nbe prepared for the consequences. He must make himself proof against\ncalumny.”“My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know,” said Mr. Brooke.\n“But how will you make yourself proof against calumny? You should read\nhistory—look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of\nthing. They always happen to the best men, you know. But what is that\nin Horace?—_fiat justitia, ruat_ … something or other.”“Exactly,” said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual. “What I\nmean by being proof against calumny is being able to point to the fact\nas a contradiction.”“And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into one’s\nself,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.But it was Sir James’s evident annoyance that most stirred Mr. Brooke.\n“Well, you know, Chettam,” he said, rising, taking up his hat and\nleaning on his stick, “you and I have a different system. You are all\nfor outlay with your farms. I don’t want to make out that my system is\ngood under all circumstances—under all circumstances, you know.”“There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time,” said Sir\nJames. “Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair\nvaluation. What do you say, Cadwallader?”“I agree with you. If I were Brooke, I would choke the ‘Trumpet’ at\nonce by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving\nhim _carte blanche_ about gates and repairs: that’s my view of the\npolitical situation,” said the Rector, broadening himself by sticking\nhis thumbs in his armholes, and laughing towards Mr. Brooke."

I let the old tenants stay on.\nI’m uncommonly easy, let me tell you, uncommonly easy. I have my own\nideas, and I take my stand on them, you know. A man who does that is\nalways charged with eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of\nthing. When I change my line of action, I shall follow my own ideas.”After that, Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which he had\nomitted to send off from the Grange, and he bade everybody hurriedly\ngood-by.“I didn’t want to take a liberty with Brooke,” said Sir James; “I see\nhe is nettled. But as to what he says about old tenants, in point of\nfact no new tenant would take the farms on the present terms.”“I have a notion that he will be brought round in time,” said the\nRector. “But you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were pulling\nanother. You wanted to frighten him away from expense, and we want to\nfrighten him into it. Better let him try to be popular and see that his\ncharacter as a landlord stands in his way. I don’t think it signifies\ntwo straws about the ‘Pioneer,’ or Ladislaw, or Brooke’s speechifying\nto the Middlemarchers. But it does signify about the parishioners in\nTipton being comfortable.”“Excuse me, it is you two who are on the wrong tack,” said Mrs.\nCadwallader. “You should have proved to him that he loses money by bad\nmanagement, and then we should all have pulled together. If you put him\na-horseback on politics, I warn you of the consequences. It was all\nvery well to ride on sticks at home and call them ideas.”CHAPTER XXXIX.“If, as I have, you also doe,\n    Vertue attired in woman see,\nAnd dare love that, and say so too,\n    And forget the He and She;And if this love, though placed so,\n    From prophane men you hide,\nWhich will no faith on this bestow,\n    Or, if they doe, deride:Then you have done a braver thing\n    Than all the Worthies did,\nAnd a braver thence will spring,\n    Which is, to keep that hid.”\n—DR.

  "content": "Sir James Chettam’s mind was not fruitful in devices, but his growing\nanxiety to “act on Brooke,” once brought close to his constant belief\nin Dorothea’s capacity for influence, became formative, and issued in a\nlittle plan; namely, to plead Celia’s indisposition as a reason for\nfetching Dorothea by herself to the Hall, and to leave her at the\nGrange with the carriage on the way, after making her fully aware of\nthe situation concerning the management of the estate.In this way it happened that one day near four o’clock, when Mr. Brooke\nand Ladislaw were seated in the library, the door opened and Mrs.\nCasaubon was announced.Will, the moment before, had been low in the depths of boredom, and,\nobliged to help Mr. Brooke in arranging “documents” about hanging\nsheep-stealers, was exemplifying the power our minds have of riding\nseveral horses at once by inwardly arranging measures towards getting a\nlodging for himself in Middlemarch and cutting short his constant\nresidence at the Grange; while there flitted through all these steadier\nimages a tickling vision of a sheep-stealing epic written with Homeric\nparticularity. When Mrs. Casaubon was announced he started up as from\nan electric shock, and felt a tingling at his finger-ends. Any one\nobserving him would have seen a change in his complexion, in the\nadjustment of his facial muscles, in the vividness of his glance, which\nmight have made them imagine that every molecule in his body had passed\nthe message of a magic touch. And so it had. For effective magic is\ntranscendent nature; and who shall measure the subtlety of those\ntouches which convey the quality of soul as well as body, and make a\nman’s passion for one woman differ from his passion for another as joy\nin the morning light over valley and river and white mountain-top\ndiffers from joy among Chinese lanterns and glass panels? Will, too,\nwas made of very impressible stuff. The bow of a violin drawn near him\ncleverly, would at one stroke change the aspect of the world for him,\nand his point of view shifted as easily as his mood. Dorothea’s\nentrance was the freshness of morning.“Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now,” said Mr. Brooke, meeting and\nkissing her. “You have left Casaubon with his books, I suppose. That’s\nright. We must not have you getting too learned for a woman, you know.”"

When I want\nto be busy with books, I am often playing truant among my thoughts. I\nfind it is not so easy to be learned as to plan cottages.”She seated herself beside her uncle opposite to Will, and was evidently\npreoccupied with something that made her almost unmindful of him. He\nwas ridiculously disappointed, as if he had imagined that her coming\nhad anything to do with him.“Why, yes, my dear, it was quite your hobby to draw plans. But it was\ngood to break that off a little. Hobbies are apt to run away with us,\nyou know; it doesn’t do to be run away with. We must keep the reins. I\nhave never let myself be run away with; I always pulled up. That is\nwhat I tell Ladislaw. He and I are alike, you know: he likes to go into\neverything. We are working at capital punishment. We shall do a great\ndeal together, Ladislaw and I.”“Yes,” said Dorothea, with characteristic directness, “Sir James has\nbeen telling me that he is in hope of seeing a great change made soon\nin your management of the estate—that you are thinking of having the\nfarms valued, and repairs made, and the cottages improved, so that\nTipton may look quite another place. Oh, how happy!”—she went on,\nclasping her hands, with a return to that more childlike impetuous\nmanner, which had been subdued since her marriage. “If I were at home\nstill, I should take to riding again, that I might go about with you\nand see all that! And you are going to engage Mr. Garth, who praised my\ncottages, Sir James says.”“Chettam is a little hasty, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke, coloring\nslightly; “a little hasty, you know. I never said I should do anything\nof the kind. I never said I should _not_ do it, you know.”"

Think of Kit Downes,\nuncle, who lives with his wife and seven children in a house with one\nsitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!—and those\npoor Dagleys, in their tumble-down farmhouse, where they live in the\nback kitchen and leave the other rooms to the rats! That is one reason\nwhy I did not like the pictures here, dear uncle—which you think me\nstupid about. I used to come from the village with all that dirt and\ncoarse ugliness like a pain within me, and the simpering pictures in\nthe drawing-room seemed to me like a wicked attempt to find delight in\nwhat is false, while we don’t mind how hard the truth is for the\nneighbors outside our walls. I think we have no right to come forward\nand urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to alter the evils\nwhich lie under our own hands.”Dorothea had gathered emotion as she went on, and had forgotten\neverything except the relief of pouring forth her feelings, unchecked:\nan experience once habitual with her, but hardly ever present since her\nmarriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear. For\nthe moment, Will’s admiration was accompanied with a chilling sense of\nremoteness. A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he cannot love a\nwoman so well when he sees a certain greatness in her: nature having\nintended greatness for men. But nature has sometimes made sad\noversights in carrying out her intention; as in the case of good Mr.\nBrooke, whose masculine consciousness was at this moment in rather a\nstammering condition under the eloquence of his niece. He could not\nimmediately find any other mode of expressing himself than that of\nrising, fixing his eye-glass, and fingering the papers before him. At\nlast he said—“There is something in what you say, my dear, something in what you\nsay—but not everything—eh, Ladislaw? You and I don’t like our pictures\nand statues being found fault with. Young ladies are a little ardent,\nyou know—a little one-sided, my dear. Fine art, poetry, that kind of\nthing, elevates a nation—_emollit mores_—you understand a little Latin\nnow. But—eh? what?”These interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come in to\nsay that the keeper had found one of Dagley’s boys with a leveret in\nhis hand just killed.“I’ll come, I’ll come. I shall let him off easily, you know,” said Mr.\nBrooke aside to Dorothea, shuffling away very cheerfully.“I hope you feel how right this change is that I—that Sir James wishes\nfor,” said Dorothea to Will, as soon as her uncle was gone."

I may\nnot have another opportunity of speaking to you about what has\noccurred,” said Will, rising with a movement of impatience, and holding\nthe back of his chair with both hands.“Pray tell me what it is,” said Dorothea, anxiously, also rising and\ngoing to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting and\nwagging his tail. She leaned her back against the window-frame, and\nlaid her hand on the dog’s head; for though, as we know, she was not\nfond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on, she was\nalways attentive to the feelings of dogs, and very polite if she had to\ndecline their advances.Will followed her only with his eyes and said, “I presume you know that\nMr. Casaubon has forbidden me to go to his house.”“No, I did not,” said Dorothea, after a moment’s pause. She was\nevidently much moved. “I am very, very sorry,” she added, mournfully.\nShe was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of—the conversation\nbetween her and her husband in the darkness; and she was anew smitten\nwith hopelessness that she could influence Mr. Casaubon’s action. But\nthe marked expression of her sorrow convinced Will that it was not all\ngiven to him personally, and that Dorothea had not been visited by the\nidea that Mr. Casaubon’s dislike and jealousy of him turned upon\nherself. He felt an odd mixture of delight and vexation: of delight\nthat he could dwell and be cherished in her thought as in a pure home,\nwithout suspicion and without stint—of vexation because he was of too\nlittle account with her, was not formidable enough, was treated with an\nunhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him. But his dread of\nany change in Dorothea was stronger than his discontent, and he began\nto speak again in a tone of mere explanation."

It is a little too hard on me to\nexpect that my course in life is to be hampered by prejudices which I\nthink ridiculous. Obligation may be stretched till it is no better than\na brand of slavery stamped on us when we were too young to know its\nmeaning. I would not have accepted the position if I had not meant to\nmake it useful and honorable. I am not bound to regard family dignity\nin any other light.”Dorothea felt wretched. She thought her husband altogether in the\nwrong, on more grounds than Will had mentioned.“It is better for us not to speak on the subject,” she said, with a\ntremulousness not common in her voice, “since you and Mr. Casaubon\ndisagree. You intend to remain?” She was looking out on the lawn, with\nmelancholy meditation.“Yes; but I shall hardly ever see you now,” said Will, in a tone of\nalmost boyish complaint.“No,” said Dorothea, turning her eyes full upon him, “hardly ever. But\nI shall hear of you. I shall know what you are doing for my uncle.”“I shall know hardly anything about you,” said Will. “No one will tell\nme anything.”“Oh, my life is very simple,” said Dorothea, her lips curling with an\nexquisite smile, which irradiated her melancholy. “I am always at\nLowick.”“That is a dreadful imprisonment,” said Will, impetuously.“No, don’t think that,” said Dorothea. “I have no longings.”He did not speak, but she replied to some change in his expression. “I\nmean, for myself. Except that I should like not to have so much more\nthan my share without doing anything for others. But I have a belief of\nmy own, and it comforts me.”“What is that?” said Will, rather jealous of the belief.“That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don’t quite know\nwhat it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power\nagainst evil—widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with\ndarkness narrower.”“That is a beautiful mysticism—it is a—”"

I have found it out, and cannot part with\nit. I have always been finding out my religion since I was a little\ngirl. I used to pray so much—now I hardly ever pray. I try not to have\ndesires merely for myself, because they may not be good for others, and\nI have too much already. I only told you, that you might know quite\nwell how my days go at Lowick.”“God bless you for telling me!” said Will, ardently, and rather\nwondering at himself. They were looking at each other like two fond\nchildren who were talking confidentially of birds.“What is _your_ religion?” said Dorothea. “I mean—not what you know\nabout religion, but the belief that helps you most?”“To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,” said Will. “But I\nam a rebel: I don’t feel bound, as you do, to submit to what I don’t\nlike.”“But if you like what is good, that comes to the same thing,” said\nDorothea, smiling.“Now you are subtle,” said Will.“Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don’t feel as if I\nwere subtle,” said Dorothea, playfully. “But how long my uncle is! I\nmust go and look for him. I must really go on to the Hall. Celia is\nexpecting me.”Will offered to tell Mr. Brooke, who presently came and said that he\nwould step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley’s,\nto speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the\nleveret. Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as they drove\nalong, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the talk under his\nown control.“Chettam, now,” he replied; “he finds fault with me, my dear; but I\nshould not preserve my game if it were not for Chettam, and he can’t\nsay that that expense is for the sake of the tenants, you know. It’s a\nlittle against my feeling:—poaching, now, if you come to look into it—I\nhave often thought of getting up the subject. Not long ago, Flavell,\nthe Methodist preacher, was brought up for knocking down a hare that\ncame across his path when he and his wife were walking out together. He\nwas pretty quick, and knocked it on the neck.”“That was very brutal, I think,” said Dorothea."

And Johnson said, ‘You may judge what a hypo_crite_\nhe is.’ And upon my word, I thought Flavell looked very little like\n‘the highest style of man’—as somebody calls the Christian—Young, the\npoet Young, I think—you know Young? Well, now, Flavell in his shabby\nblack gaiters, pleading that he thought the Lord had sent him and his\nwife a good dinner, and he had a right to knock it down, though not a\nmighty hunter before the Lord, as Nimrod was—I assure you it was rather\ncomic: Fielding would have made something of it—or Scott, now—Scott\nmight have worked it up. But really, when I came to think of it, I\ncouldn’t help liking that the fellow should have a bit of hare to say\ngrace over. It’s all a matter of prejudice—prejudice with the law on\nits side, you know—about the stick and the gaiters, and so on. However,\nit doesn’t do to reason about things; and law is law. But I got Johnson\nto be quiet, and I hushed the matter up. I doubt whether Chettam would\nnot have been more severe, and yet he comes down on me as if I were the\nhardest man in the county. But here we are at Dagley’s.”Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is\nwonderful how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we\nare blamed for them. Even our own persons in the glass are apt to\nchange their aspect for us after we have heard some frank remark on\ntheir less admirable points; and on the other hand it is astonishing\nhow pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never\ncomplain or have nobody to complain for them. Dagley’s homestead never\nbefore looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as it did today, with his mind\nthus sore about the fault-finding of the “Trumpet,” echoed by Sir\nJames."

  "content": "It is true that an observer, under that softening influence of the fine\narts which makes other people’s hardships picturesque, might have been\ndelighted with this homestead called Freeman’s End: the old house had\ndormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked\nwith ivy, the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and\nhalf the windows were closed with gray worm-eaten shutters about which\nthe jasmine-boughs grew in wild luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall\nwith hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled\nsubdued color, and there was an aged goat (kept doubtless on\ninteresting superstitious grounds) lying against the open back-kitchen\ndoor. The mossy thatch of the cow-shed, the broken gray barn-doors, the\npauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a\nwagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty dairy\nof cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in\nbrown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about\nthe uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too\nmeagre quality of rinsings,—all these objects under the quiet light of\na sky marbled with high clouds would have made a sort of picture which\nwe have all paused over as a “charming bit,” touching other\nsensibilities than those which are stirred by the depression of the\nagricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming capital, as seen\nconstantly in the newspapers of that time. But these troublesome\nassociations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke, and spoiled\nthe scene for him. Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the landscape,\ncarrying a pitchfork and wearing his milking-hat—a very old beaver\nflattened in front. His coat and breeches were the best he had, and he\nwould not have been wearing them on this weekday occasion if he had not\nbeen to market and returned later than usual, having given himself the\nrare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull. How he came\nto fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to\nhimself on the morrow; but before dinner something in the state of the\ncountry, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut,\nthe stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls,\nhad seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim about\nMiddlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should have\ngood drink, which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well\nfollowed up by rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in them\nthat they were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry: they\nonly made his discontent less tongue-tied than usual. He had also taken\ntoo much in the shape of muddy political talk, a stimulant dangerously\ndisturbing to his farming conservatism, which consisted in holding that\nwhatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse. He was\nflushed, and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he stood\nstill grasping his pitchfork, while the landlord approached with his\neasy shuffling walk, one hand in his trouser-pocket and the other\nswinging round a thin walking-stick."

Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said\nDagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog stir\nfrom his seat and prick his ears; but seeing Monk enter the yard after\nsome outside loitering, Fag seated himself again in an attitude of\nobservation. “I’m glad to hear I’m a good feller.”Mr. Brooke reflected that it was market-day, and that his worthy tenant\nhad probably been dining, but saw no reason why he should not go on,\nsince he could take the precaution of repeating what he had to say to\nMrs. Dagley.“Your little lad Jacob has been caught killing a leveret, Dagley: I\nhave told Johnson to lock him up in the empty stable an hour or two,\njust to frighten him, you know. But he will be brought home by-and-by,\nbefore night: and you’ll just look after him, will you, and give him a\nreprimand, you know?”“No, I woon’t: I’ll be dee’d if I’ll leather my boy to please you or\nanybody else, not if you was twenty landlords istid o’ one, and that a\nbad un.”Dagley’s words were loud enough to summon his wife to the back-kitchen\ndoor—the only entrance ever used, and one always open except in bad\nweather—and Mr. Brooke, saying soothingly, “Well, well, I’ll speak to\nyour wife—I didn’t mean beating, you know,” turned to walk to the\nhouse. But Dagley, only the more inclined to “have his say” with a\ngentleman who walked away from him, followed at once, with Fag\nslouching at his heels and sullenly evading some small and probably\ncharitable advances on the part of Monk.“How do you do, Mrs. Dagley?” said Mr. Brooke, making some haste. “I\ncame to tell you about your boy: I don’t want you to give him the\nstick, you know.” He was careful to speak quite plainly this time."

But her husband was beforehand in\nanswering.“No, nor he woon’t hev the stick, whether you want it or no,” pursued\nDagley, throwing out his voice, as if he wanted it to hit hard. “You’ve\ngot no call to come an’ talk about sticks o’ these primises, as you\nwoon’t give a stick tow’rt mending. Go to Middlemarch to ax for _your_\ncharrickter.”“You’d far better hold your tongue, Dagley,” said the wife, “and not\nkick your own trough over. When a man as is father of a family has been\nan’ spent money at market and made himself the worse for liquor, he’s\ndone enough mischief for one day. But I should like to know what my\nboy’s done, sir.”“Niver do you mind what he’s done,” said Dagley, more fiercely, “it’s\nmy business to speak, an’ not yourn. An’ I wull speak, too. I’ll hev my\nsay—supper or no. An’ what I say is, as I’ve lived upo’ your ground\nfrom my father and grandfather afore me, an’ hev dropped our money\ninto’t, an’ me an’ my children might lie an’ rot on the ground for\ntop-dressin’ as we can’t find the money to buy, if the King wasn’t to\nput a stop.”“My good fellow, you’re drunk, you know,” said Mr. Brooke,\nconfidentially but not judiciously. “Another day, another day,” he\nadded, turning as if to go.But Dagley immediately fronted him, and Fag at his heels growled low,\nas his master’s voice grew louder and more insulting, while Monk also\ndrew close in silent dignified watch.

That’s what I’n got\nto say,” concluded Mr. Dagley, striking his fork into the ground with a\nfirmness which proved inconvenient as he tried to draw it up again.At this last action Monk began to bark loudly, and it was a moment for\nMr. Brooke to escape. He walked out of the yard as quickly as he could,\nin some amazement at the novelty of his situation. He had never been\ninsulted on his own land before, and had been inclined to regard\nhimself as a general favorite (we are all apt to do so, when we think\nof our own amiability more than of what other people are likely to want\nof us). When he had quarrelled with Caleb Garth twelve years before he\nhad thought that the tenants would be pleased at the landlord’s taking\neverything into his own hands.Some who follow the narrative of his experience may wonder at the\nmidnight darkness of Mr. Dagley; but nothing was easier in those times\nthan for an hereditary farmer of his grade to be ignorant, in spite\nsomehow of having a rector in the twin parish who was a gentleman to\nthe backbone, a curate nearer at hand who preached more learnedly than\nthe rector, a landlord who had gone into everything, especially fine\nart and social improvement, and all the lights of Middlemarch only\nthree miles off. As to the facility with which mortals escape\nknowledge, try an average acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of\nLondon, and consider what that eligible person for a dinner-party would\nhave been if he had learned scant skill in “summing” from the\nparish-clerk of Tipton, and read a chapter in the Bible with immense\ndifficulty, because such names as Isaiah or Apollos remained\nunmanageable after twice spelling. Poor Dagley read a few verses\nsometimes on a Sunday evening, and the world was at least not darker to\nhim than it had been before. Some things he knew thoroughly, namely,\nthe slovenly habits of farming, and the awkwardness of weather, stock\nand crops, at Freeman’s End—so called apparently by way of sarcasm, to\nimply that a man was free to quit it if he chose, but that there was no\nearthly “beyond” open to him.CHAPTER XL."
