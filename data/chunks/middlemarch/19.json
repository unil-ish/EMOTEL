  "content": "“Ostentation, Hackbutt?” said Mr. Toller, ironically. “I don’t see\nthat. A man can’t very well be ostentatious of what nobody believes in.\nThere’s no reform in the matter: the question is, whether the profit on\nthe drugs is paid to the medical man by the druggist or by the patient,\nand whether there shall be extra pay under the name of attendance.”“Ah, to be sure; one of your damned new versions of old humbug,” said\nMr. Hawley, passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench.Mr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely at a\nparty, getting the more irritable in consequence.“As to humbug, Hawley,” he said, “that’s a word easy to fling about.\nBut what I contend against is the way medical men are fouling their own\nnest, and setting up a cry about the country as if a general\npractitioner who dispenses drugs couldn’t be a gentleman. I throw back\nthe imputation with scorn. I say, the most ungentlemanly trick a man\ncan be guilty of is to come among the members of his profession with\ninnovations which are a libel on their time-honored procedure. That is\nmy opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who\ncontradicts me.” Mr. Wrench’s voice had become exceedingly sharp.“I can’t oblige you there, Wrench,” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his\nhands into his trouser-pockets.“My dear fellow,” said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically, and looking\nat Mr. Wrench, “the physicians have their toes trodden on more than we\nhave. If you come to dignity it is a question for Minchin and Sprague.”“Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these\ninfringements?” said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to offer\nhis lights. “How does the law stand, eh, Hawley?”“Nothing to be done there,” said Mr. Hawley. “I looked into it for\nSprague. You’d only break your nose against a damned judge’s decision.”“Pooh! no need of law,” said Mr. Toller. “So far as practice is\nconcerned the attempt is an absurdity. No patient will like\nit—certainly not Peacock’s, who have been used to depletion. Pass the\nwine.”"

  "content": "Mr. Toller’s prediction was partly verified. If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey,\nwho had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by his supposed\ndeclaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called him\nin should watch a little anxiously to see whether he did “use all the\nmeans he might use” in the case. Even good Mr. Powderell, who in his\nconstant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the\nmore for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his\nmind disturbed with doubts during his wife’s attack of erysipelas, and\ncould not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a\nsimilar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not\notherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs.\nPowderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a\nremarkably hot August. At last, indeed, in the conflict between his\ndesire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no “means” should be\nlacking, he induced his wife privately to take Widgeon’s Purifying\nPills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease\nat the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood. This\nco-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mr.\nPowderell himself had no certain reliance on it, only hoping that it\nmight be attended with a blessing.But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate’s introduction he was helped by\nwhat we mortals rashly call good fortune. I suppose no doctor ever came\nnewly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody—cures\nwhich may be called fortune’s testimonials, and deserve as much credit\nas the written or printed kind. Various patients got well while Lydgate\nwas attending them, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it was\nremarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the merit\nof bringing people back from the brink of death. The trash talked on\nsuch occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it gave\nprecisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous\nman would desire, and was sure to be imputed to him by the simmering\ndislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his own part of\nignorant puffing. But even his proud outspokenness was checked by the\ndiscernment that it was as useless to fight against the interpretations\nof ignorance as to whip the fog; and “good fortune” insisted on using\nthose interpretations."

  "content": "Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming\nsymptoms in her charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked him to see\nher then and there, and to give her a certificate for the Infirmary;\nwhereupon after examination he wrote a statement of the case as one of\ntumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient. Nancy,\ncalling at home on her way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and\nhis wife, in whose attic she lodged, to read Dr. Minchin’s paper, and\nby this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the\nneighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at\nfirst declared to be as large and hard as a duck’s egg, but later in\nthe day to be about the size of “your fist.” Most hearers agreed that\nit would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of\n“squitchineal” as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body\nwhen taken enough of into the inside—the oil by gradually “soopling,”\nthe squitchineal by eating away.Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it happened to\nbe one of Lydgate’s days there. After questioning and examining her,\nLydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, “It’s not tumor:\nit’s cramp.” He ordered her a blister and some steel mixture, and told\nher to go home and rest, giving her at the same time a note to Mrs.\nLarcher, who, she said, was her best employer, to testify that she was\nin need of good food."

  "content": "But by-and-by Nancy, in her attic, became portentously worse, the\nsupposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only\nwandered to another region with angrier pain. The staymaker’s wife went\nto fetch Lydgate, and he continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy in\nher own home, until under his treatment she got quite well and went to\nwork again. But the case continued to be described as one of tumor in\nChurchyard Lane and other streets—nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for when\nLydgate’s remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin, he naturally\ndid not like to say, “The case was not one of tumor, and I was mistaken\nin describing it as such,” but answered, “Indeed! ah! I saw it was a\nsurgical case, not of a fatal kind.” He had been inwardly annoyed,\nhowever, when he had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he had\nrecommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a\nyoungster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what\nhad occurred: he privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general\npractitioner to contradict a physician’s diagnosis in that open manner,\nand afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably\ninattentive to etiquette. Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for\nvaluing himself or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such\nrectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal\nqualifications. But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not\nclearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for\nbeing of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate’s\nmethod as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his marvellous skill in\nthe speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she had been rolling and\nrolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and\nobstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield.How could Lydgate help himself? It is offensive to tell a lady when she\nis expressing her amazement at your skill, that she is altogether\nmistaken and rather foolish in her amazement. And to have entered into\nthe nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical\npropriety. Thus he had to wince under a promise of success given by\nthat ignorant praise which misses every valid quality.In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull,\nLydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an\nevery-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he\nwon. The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having been\na patient of Mr. Peacock’s, sent for Lydgate, whom he had expressed his\nintention to patronize. Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a good subject\nfor trying the expectant theory upon—watching the course of an\ninteresting disease when left as much as possible to itself, so that\nthe stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air with\nwhich he described his sensations Lydgate surmised that he would like\nto be taken into his medical man’s confidence, and be represented as a\npartner in his own cure. The auctioneer heard, without much surprise,\nthat his was a constitution which (always with due watching) might be\nleft to itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with\nall its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he probably had the\nrare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational\nprocedure, and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a\ngeneral benefit to society.Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view\nthat an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science."

And he\nwent without shrinking through his abstinence from drugs, much\nsustained by application of the thermometer which implied the\nimportance of his temperature, by the sense that he furnished objects\nfor the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited\nto the dignity of his secretions. For Lydgate was acute enough to\nindulge him with a little technical talk.It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a\ndisposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the\nstrength of his mind as well as constitution; and he was not backward\nin awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of\npatient he had to deal with. The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man,\nand liked to give others their due, feeling that he could afford it. He\nhad caught the words “expectant method,” and rang chimes on this and\nother learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate “knew a\nthing or two more than the rest of the doctors—was far better versed in\nthe secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers.”This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy’s illness had given\nto Mr. Wrench’s enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground.\nThe new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of\nrivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical\ncriticism or reflections on his hard-driven elders, who had had\nsomething else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions. His\npractice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the\nreport of his high family had led to his being pretty generally\ninvited, so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the\nbest houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed\nalways to end in a mutual attachment. There was hardly ever so much\nunanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant\nyoung fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to\nshow a crawling subservience to Bulstrode. That Mr. Farebrother, whose\nname was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended\nLydgate and made a friend of him, was referred to Farebrother’s\nunaccountable way of fighting on both sides."

Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be\nsorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of\nimprovement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but he had\nhad to spend large sums, and the building had lingered. Caleb Garth had\nundertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the interior\nfittings were begun had retired from the management of the business;\nand when referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode\nmight ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry and masonry,\nand had a notion both of drains and chimneys. In fact, the Hospital had\nbecome an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and he would\nwillingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule\nit dictatorially without any Board; but he had another favorite object\nwhich also required money for its accomplishment: he wished to buy some\nland in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and therefore he wished to get\nconsiderable contributions towards maintaining the Hospital. Meanwhile\nhe framed his plan of management. The Hospital was to be reserved for\nfever in all its forms; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent,\nthat he might have free authority to pursue all comparative\ninvestigations which his studies, particularly in Paris, had shown him\nthe importance of, the other medical visitors having a consultative\ninfluence, but no power to contravene Lydgate’s ultimate decisions; and\nthe general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of\nfive directors associated with Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in\nthe ratio of their contributions, the Board itself filling up any\nvacancy in its numbers, and no mob of small contributors being admitted\nto a share of government."

  "content": "There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the\ntown to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital.“Very well,” said Lydgate to Mr. Bulstrode, “we have a capital\nhouse-surgeon and dispenser, a clear-headed, neat-handed fellow; we’ll\nget Webbe from Crabsley, as good a country practitioner as any of them,\nto come over twice a-week, and in case of any exceptional operation,\nProtheroe will come from Brassing. I must work the harder, that’s all,\nand I have given up my post at the Infirmary. The plan will flourish in\nspite of them, and then they’ll be glad to come in. Things can’t last\nas they are: there must be all sorts of reform soon, and then young\nfellows may be glad to come and study here.” Lydgate was in high\nspirits.“I shall not flinch, you may depend upon it, Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr.\nBulstrode. “While I see you carrying out high intentions with vigor,\nyou shall have my unfailing support. And I have humble confidence that\nthe blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit\nof evil in this town will not be withdrawn. Suitable directors to\nassist me I have no doubt of securing. Mr. Brooke of Tipton has already\ngiven me his concurrence, and a pledge to contribute yearly: he has not\nspecified the sum—probably not a great one. But he will be a useful\nmember of the board.”A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate\nnothing, and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode.The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now. Neither Dr.\nSprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he disliked Lydgate’s knowledge, or\nhis disposition to improve treatment: what they disliked was his\narrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether deniable. They implied\nthat he was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless\ninnovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the\ncharlatan."

  "content": "The word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop. In\nthose days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St.\nJohn Long, “noblemen and gentlemen” attesting his extraction of a fluid\nlike mercury from the temples of a patient.Mr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that “Bulstrode\nhad found a man to suit him in Lydgate; a charlatan in religion is sure\nto like other sorts of charlatans.”“Yes, indeed, I can imagine,” said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number of\nthirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while; “there are so many\nof that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his irons, trying to make\npeople straight when the Almighty had made them crooked.”“No, no,” said Mr. Toller, “Cheshire was all right—all fair and above\nboard. But there’s St. John Long—that’s the kind of fellow we call a\ncharlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about: a\nfellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other\npeople. The other day he was pretending to tap a man’s brain and get\nquicksilver out of it.”“Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people’s constitutions!”\nsaid Mrs. Taft.After this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played\neven with respectable constitutions for his own purposes, and how much\nmore likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and\nsevens of hospital patients. Especially it was to be expected, as the\nlandlady of the Tankard had said, that he would recklessly cut up their\ndead bodies. For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby, who died apparently\nof a heart-disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms, too\ndaringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body, and thus gave\nan offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street, where that lady had\nlong resided on an income such as made this association of her body\nwith the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her memory.Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the\nHospital to Dorothea. We see that he was bearing enmity and silly\nmisconception with much spirit, aware that they were partly created by\nhis good share of success."

By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as possible: I have no\nseductions now away from home and work. And I am more and more\nconvinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous\norigin of all the tissues. Raspail and others are on the same track,\nand I have been losing time.”“I have no power of prophecy there,” said Mr. Farebrother, who had been\npuffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked; “but as to the\nhostility in the town, you’ll weather it if you are prudent.”“How am I to be prudent?” said Lydgate, “I just do what comes before me\nto do. I can’t help people’s ignorance and spite, any more than\nVesalius could. It isn’t possible to square one’s conduct to silly\nconclusions which nobody can foresee.”“Quite true; I didn’t mean that. I meant only two things. One is, keep\nyourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of course, you can go\non doing good work of your own by his help; but don’t get tied. Perhaps\nit seems like personal feeling in me to say so—and there’s a good deal\nof that, I own—but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you\nboil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion.”“Bulstrode is nothing to me,” said Lydgate, carelessly, “except on\npublic grounds. As to getting very closely united to him, I am not fond\nenough of him for that. But what was the other thing you meant?” said\nLydgate, who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible, and\nfeeling in no great need of advice.“Why, this. Take care—_experto crede_—take care not to get hampered\nabout money matters. I know, by a word you let fall one day, that you\ndon’t like my playing at cards so much for money. You are right enough\nthere. But try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven’t\ngot. I am perhaps talking rather superfluously; but a man likes to\nassume superiority over himself, by holding up his bad example and\nsermonizing on it.”Lydgate took Mr. Farebrother’s hints very cordially, though he would\nhardly have borne them from another man. He could not help remembering\nthat he had lately made some debts, but these had seemed inevitable,\nand he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way.\nThe furniture for which he owed would not want renewing; nor even the\nstock of wine for a long while."

A man conscious of\nenthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the\nmemory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds,\nand who hover in his mind as patron saints, invisibly helping. At home,\nthat same evening when he had been chatting with Mr. Farebrother, he\nhad his long legs stretched on the sofa, his head thrown back, and his\nhands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating attitude,\nwhile Rosamond sat at the piano, and played one tune after another, of\nwhich her husband only knew (like the emotional elephant he was!) that\nthey fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea-breezes.There was something very fine in Lydgate’s look just then, and any one\nmight have been encouraged to bet on his achievement. In his dark eyes\nand on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the\nfulness of contemplative thought—the mind not searching, but beholding,\nand the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it.Presently Rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close\nto the sofa and opposite her husband’s face.“Is that enough music for you, my lord?” she said, folding her hands\nbefore her and putting on a little air of meekness.“Yes, dear, if you are tired,” said Lydgate, gently, turning his eyes\nand resting them on her, but not otherwise moving. Rosamond’s presence\nat that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake,\nand her woman’s instinct in this matter was not dull.“What is absorbing you?” she said, leaning forward and bringing her\nface nearer to his.He moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders.“I am thinking of a great fellow, who was about as old as I am three\nhundred years ago, and had already begun a new era in anatomy.”“I can’t guess,” said Rosamond, shaking her head. “We used to play at\nguessing historical characters at Mrs. Lemon’s, but not anatomists.”“I’ll tell you. His name was Vesalius. And the only way he could get to\nknow anatomy as he did, was by going to snatch bodies at night, from\ngraveyards and places of execution.”“Oh!” said Rosamond, with a look of disgust on her pretty face, “I am\nvery glad you are not Vesalius. I should have thought he might find\nsome less horrible way than that.”“No, he couldn’t,” said Lydgate, going on too earnestly to take much\nnotice of her answer. “He could only get a complete skeleton by\nsnatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows, and\nburying them, and fetching them away by bits secretly, in the dead of\nnight.”"

No wonder the medical fogies in Middlemarch are\njealous, when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon\nVesalius because they had believed in Galen, and he showed that Galen\nwas wrong. They called him a liar and a poisonous monster. But the\nfacts of the human frame were on his side; and so he got the better of\nthem.”“And what happened to him afterwards?” said Rosamond, with some\ninterest.“Oh, he had a good deal of fighting to the last. And they did\nexasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his\nwork. Then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from Jerusalem to\ntake a great chair at Padua. He died rather miserably.”There was a moment’s pause before Rosamond said, “Do you know, Tertius,\nI often wish you had not been a medical man.”“Nay, Rosy, don’t say that,” said Lydgate, drawing her closer to him.\n“That is like saying you wish you had married another man.”“Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might easily have\nbeen something else. And your cousins at Quallingham all think that you\nhave sunk below them in your choice of a profession.”“The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!” said Lydgate, with\nscorn. “It was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort\nto you.”“Still,” said Rosamond, “I do _not_ think it is a nice profession,\ndear.” We know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion.“It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond,” said Lydgate,\ngravely. “And to say that you love me without loving the medical man in\nme, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach\nbut don’t like its flavor. Don’t say that again, dear, it pains me.”“Very well, Doctor Grave-face,” said Rosy, dimpling, “I will declare in\nfuture that I dote on skeletons, and body-snatchers, and bits of things\nin phials, and quarrels with everybody, that end in your dying\nmiserably.”“No, no, not so bad as that,” said Lydgate, giving up remonstrance and\npetting her resignedly."

And there were some who already\npredicted this event, declaring that a Reform Bill would never be\ncarried by the actual Parliament. This was what Will Ladislaw dwelt on\nto Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried\nhis strength at the hustings.“Things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year,” said Will.\n“The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the question\nof Reform has set in. There is likely to be another election before\nlong, and by that time Middlemarch will have got more ideas into its\nhead. What we have to work at now is the ‘Pioneer’ and political\nmeetings.”“Quite right, Ladislaw; we shall make a new thing of opinion here,”\nsaid Mr. Brooke. “Only I want to keep myself independent about Reform,\nyou know; I don’t want to go too far. I want to take up Wilberforce’s\nand Romilly’s line, you know, and work at Negro Emancipation, Criminal\nLaw—that kind of thing. But of course I should support Grey.”“If you go in for the principle of Reform, you must be prepared to take\nwhat the situation offers,” said Will. “If everybody pulled for his own\nbit against everybody else, the whole question would go to tatters.”"

It wants to have a House of Commons which is not weighted\nwith nominees of the landed class, but with representatives of the\nother interests. And as to contending for a reform short of that, it is\nlike asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to\nthunder.”“That is fine, Ladislaw: that is the way to put it. Write that down,\nnow. We must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country,\nas well as the machine-breaking and general distress.”“As to documents,” said Will, “a two-inch card will hold plenty. A few\nrows of figures are enough to deduce misery from, and a few more will\nshow the rate at which the political determination of the people is\ngrowing.”“Good: draw that out a little more at length, Ladislaw.

Burke, now:—when I think of Burke, I\ncan’t help wishing somebody had a pocket-borough to give you, Ladislaw.\nYou’d never get elected, you know. And we shall always want talent in\nthe House: reform as we will, we shall always want talent. That\navalanche and the thunder, now, was really a little like Burke. I want\nthat sort of thing—not ideas, you know, but a way of putting them.”“Pocket-boroughs would be a fine thing,” said Ladislaw, “if they were\nalways in the right pocket, and there were always a Burke at hand.”"

  "content": "Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even from\nMr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be\nconscious of expressing one’s self better than others and never to have\nit noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the right\nthing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather\nfortifying. Will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond\nthe limits of Middlemarch perception; nevertheless, he was beginning\nthoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to\nhimself rather languidly, “Why not?”—and he studied the political\nsituation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic\nmetres or mediaevalism. It is undeniable that but for the desire to be\nwhere Dorothea was, and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do,\nWill would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the\nEnglish people or criticising English statesmanship: he would probably\nhave been rambling in Italy sketching plans for several dramas, trying\nprose and finding it too jejune, trying verse and finding it too\nartificial, beginning to copy “bits” from old pictures, leaving off\nbecause they were “no good,” and observing that, after all,\nself-culture was the principal point; while in politics he would have\nbeen sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general. Our\nsense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place\nof dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not\na matter of indifference.Ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work, though it was not that\nindeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone\nworthy of continuous effort. His nature warmed easily in the presence\nof subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action, and the\neasily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit. In\nspite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick, he was rather\nhappy; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for\npractical purposes, and making the “Pioneer” celebrated as far as\nBrassing (never mind the smallness of the area; the writing was not\nworse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth).Mr. Brooke was occasionally irritating; but Will’s impatience was\nrelieved by the division of his time between visits to the Grange and\nretreats to his Middlemarch lodgings, which gave variety to his life.“Shift the pegs a little,” he said to himself, “and Mr. Brooke might be\nin the Cabinet, while I was Under-Secretary. That is the common order\nof things: the little waves make the large ones and are of the same\npattern. I am better here than in the sort of life Mr. Casaubon would\nhave trained me for, where the doing would be all laid down by a\nprecedent too rigid for me to react upon. I don’t care for prestige or\nhigh pay.”"

That sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had\nfelt some new distance between himself and Dorothea in their accidental\nmeeting at Lydgate’s, and his irritation had gone out towards Mr.\nCasaubon, who had declared beforehand that Will would lose caste. “I\nnever had any caste,” he would have said, if that prophecy had been\nuttered to him, and the quick blood would have come and gone like\nbreath in his transparent skin. But it is one thing to like defiance,\nand another thing to like its consequences.Meanwhile, the town opinion about the new editor of the “Pioneer” was\ntending to confirm Mr. Casaubon’s view. Will’s relationship in that\ndistinguished quarter did not, like Lydgate’s high connections, serve\nas an advantageous introduction: if it was rumored that young Ladislaw\nwas Mr. Casaubon’s nephew or cousin, it was also rumored that “Mr.\nCasaubon would have nothing to do with him.”“Brooke has taken him up,” said Mr. Hawley, “because that is what no\nman in his senses could have expected. Casaubon has devilish good\nreasons, you may be sure, for turning the cold shoulder on a young\nfellow whose bringing-up he paid for. Just like Brooke—one of those\nfellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse.”And some oddities of Will’s, more or less poetical, appeared to support\nMr. Keck, the editor of the “Trumpet,” in asserting that Ladislaw, if\nthe truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary but crack-brained,\nwhich accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his\nspeech when he got on to a platform—as he did whenever he had an\nopportunity, speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid\nEnglishmen generally. It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a\nfellow, with light curls round his head, get up and speechify by the\nhour against institutions “which had existed when he was in his\ncradle.” And in a leading article of the “Trumpet,” Keck characterized\nLadislaw’s speech at a Reform meeting as “the violence of an\nenergumen—a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks\nthe daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge\nwhich was of the cheapest and most recent description.”“That was a rattling article yesterday, Keck,” said Dr. Sprague, with\nsarcastic intentions. “But what is an energumen?”“Oh, a term that came up in the French Revolution,” said Keck."

  "content": "This dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other\nhabits which became matter of remark. He had a fondness, half artistic,\nhalf affectionate, for little children—the smaller they were on\ntolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the better Will\nliked to surprise and please them. We know that in Rome he was given to\nramble about among the poor people, and the taste did not quit him in\nMiddlemarch.He had somehow picked up a troop of droll children, little hatless boys\nwith their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out,\nlittle girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him,\nand guardian brothers at the mature age of seven. This troop he had led\nout on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at nutting-time, and since the\ncold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather\nsticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside, where he drew out a\nsmall feast of gingerbread for them, and improvised a Punch-and-Judy\ndrama with some private home-made puppets. Here was one oddity. Another\nwas, that in houses where he got friendly, he was given to stretch\nhimself at full length on the rug while he talked, and was apt to be\ndiscovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an\nirregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed\nblood and general laxity.But Will’s articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families\nwhich the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side\nof Reform. He was invited to Mr. Bulstrode’s; but here he could not lie\ndown on the rug, and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his mode of talking about\nCatholic countries, as if there were any truce with Antichrist,\nillustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men.At Mr. Farebrother’s, however, whom the irony of events had brought on\nthe same side with Bulstrode in the national movement, Will became a\nfavorite with the ladies; especially with little Miss Noble, whom it\nwas one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with\nher little basket, giving her his arm in the eyes of the town, and\ninsisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her\nsmall filchings from her own share of sweet things."

Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable, taking little notice of\nmegrims in healthy people; and Ladislaw did not usually throw away his\nsusceptibilities on those who took no notice of them. With Rosamond, on\nthe other hand, he pouted and was wayward—nay, often uncomplimentary,\nmuch to her inward surprise; nevertheless he was gradually becoming\nnecessary to her entertainment by his companionship in her music, his\nvaried talk, and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which, with\nall her husband’s tenderness and indulgence, often made his manners\nunsatisfactory to her, and confirmed her dislike of the medical\nprofession.Lydgate, inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the\npeople in the efficacy of “the bill,” while nobody cared about the low\nstate of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions.\nOne evening in March, Rosamond in her cherry-colored dress with\nswansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea-table; Lydgate,\nlately come in tired from his outdoor work, was seated sideways on an\neasy-chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow, his brow looking a\nlittle troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the “Pioneer,”\nwhile Rosamond, having noticed that he was perturbed, avoided looking\nat him, and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody\ndisposition. Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the\ncurtain-pole abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of “When\nfirst I saw thy face;” while the house spaniel, also stretched out with\nsmall choice of room, looked from between his paws at the usurper of\nthe rug with silent but strong objection.Rosamond bringing Lydgate his cup of tea, he threw down the paper, and\nsaid to Will, who had started up and gone to the table—“It’s no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord, Ladislaw:\nthey only pick the more holes in his coat in the ‘Trumpet.’”“No matter; those who read the ‘Pioneer’ don’t read the ‘Trumpet,’”\nsaid Will, swallowing his tea and walking about. “Do you suppose the\npublic reads with a view to its own conversion? We should have a\nwitches’ brewing with a vengeance then—‘Mingle, mingle, mingle, mingle,\nYou that mingle may’—and nobody would know which side he was going to\ntake.”“Farebrother says, he doesn’t believe Brooke would get elected if the\nopportunity came: the very men who profess to be for him would bring\nanother member out of the bag at the right moment.”“There’s no harm in trying. It’s good to have resident members.”“Why?” said Lydgate, who was much given to use that inconvenient word\nin a curt tone."

Brooke is not a bad fellow, but he has done some good\nthings on his estate that he never would have done but for this\nParliamentary bite.”“He’s not fitted to be a public man,” said Lydgate, with contemptuous\ndecision. “He would disappoint everybody who counted on him: I can see\nthat at the Hospital. Only, there Bulstrode holds the reins and drives\nhim.”“That depends on how you fix your standard of public men,” said Will.\n“He’s good enough for the occasion: when the people have made up their\nmind as they are making it up now, they don’t want a man—they only want\na vote.”“That is the way with you political writers, Ladislaw—crying up a\nmeasure as if it were a universal cure, and crying up men who are a\npart of the very disease that wants curing.”“Why not? Men may help to cure themselves off the face of the land\nwithout knowing it,” said Will, who could find reasons impromptu, when\nhe had not thought of a question beforehand.“That is no excuse for encouraging the superstitious exaggeration of\nhopes about this particular measure, helping the cry to swallow it\nwhole and to send up voting popinjays who are good for nothing but to\ncarry it. You go against rottenness, and there is nothing more\nthoroughly rotten than making people believe that society can be cured\nby a political hocus-pocus.”“That’s very fine, my dear fellow. But your cure must begin somewhere,\nand put it that a thousand things which debase a population can never\nbe reformed without this particular reform to begin with. Look what\nStanley said the other day—that the House had been tinkering long\nenough at small questions of bribery, inquiring whether this or that\nvoter has had a guinea when everybody knows that the seats have been\nsold wholesale. Wait for wisdom and conscience in public\nagents—fiddlestick! The only conscience we can trust to is the massive\nsense of wrong in a class, and the best wisdom that will work is the\nwisdom of balancing claims. That’s my text—which side is injured? I\nsupport the man who supports their claims; not the virtuous upholder of\nthe wrong.”"

Should you go on that\nplan? If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform and\nanother who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the better\nmotives or even the better brains?”“Oh, of course,” said Lydgate, seeing himself checkmated by a move\nwhich he had often used himself, “if one did not work with such men as\nare at hand, things must come to a dead-lock. Suppose the worst opinion\nin the town about Bulstrode were a true one, that would not make it\nless true that he has the sense and the resolution to do what I think\nought to be done in the matters I know and care most about; but that is\nthe only ground on which I go with him,” Lydgate added rather proudly,\nbearing in mind Mr. Farebrother’s remarks. “He is nothing to me\notherwise; I would not cry him up on any personal ground—I would keep\nclear of that.”“Do you mean that I cry up Brooke on any personal ground?” said Will\nLadislaw, nettled, and turning sharp round. For the first time he felt\noffended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he would have\ndeclined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr.\nBrooke.“Not at all,” said Lydgate, “I was simply explaining my own action. I\nmeant that a man may work for a special end with others whose motives\nand general course are equivocal, if he is quite sure of his personal\nindependence, and that he is not working for his private\ninterest—either place or money.”"

Motives are points of honor, I\nsuppose—nobody can prove them. But as to money and place in the world,”\nWill ended, tossing back his head, “I think it is pretty clear that I\nam not determined by considerations of that sort.”“You quite mistake me, Ladislaw,” said Lydgate, surprised. He had been\npreoccupied with his own vindication, and had been blind to what\nLadislaw might infer on his own account. “I beg your pardon for\nunintentionally annoying you. In fact, I should rather attribute to you\na romantic disregard of your own worldly interests. On the political\nquestion, I referred simply to intellectual bias.”“How very unpleasant you both are this evening!” said Rosamond. “I\ncannot conceive why money should have been referred to. Politics and\nMedicine are sufficiently disagreeable to quarrel upon. You can both of\nyou go on quarrelling with all the world and with each other on those\ntwo topics.”Rosamond looked mildly neutral as she said this, rising to ring the\nbell, and then crossing to her work-table.“Poor Rosy!” said Lydgate, putting out his hand to her as she was\npassing him. “Disputation is not amusing to cherubs. Have some music.\nAsk Ladislaw to sing with you.”When Will was gone Rosamond said to her husband, “What put you out of\ntemper this evening, Tertius?”“Me? It was Ladislaw who was out of temper. He is like a bit of\ntinder.”“But I mean, before that. Something had vexed you before you came in,\nyou looked cross. And that made you begin to dispute with Mr. Ladislaw.\nYou hurt me very much when you look so, Tertius.”“Do I? Then I am a brute,” said Lydgate, caressing her penitently.“What vexed you?”“Oh, outdoor things—business.” It was really a letter insisting on the\npayment of a bill for furniture. But Rosamond was expecting to have a\nbaby, and Lydgate wished to save her from any perturbation.CHAPTER XLVII.Was never true love loved in vain,\nFor truest love is highest gain.\nNo art can make it: it must spring\nWhere elements are fostering.\nSo in heaven’s spot and hour\nSprings the little native flower,\nDownward root and upward eye,\nShapen by the earth and sky."
