  "content": "“How should I be able now to persevere in any path without your\ncompanionship?” said Mr. Casaubon, kissing her candid brow, and feeling\nthat heaven had vouchsafed him a blessing in every way suited to his\npeculiar wants. He was being unconsciously wrought upon by the charms\nof a nature which was entirely without hidden calculations either for\nimmediate effects or for remoter ends. It was this which made Dorothea\nso childlike, and, according to some judges, so stupid, with all her\nreputed cleverness; as, for example, in the present case of throwing\nherself, metaphorically speaking, at Mr. Casaubon’s feet, and kissing\nhis unfashionable shoe-ties as if he were a Protestant Pope. She was\nnot in the least teaching Mr. Casaubon to ask if he were good enough\nfor her, but merely asking herself anxiously how she could be good\nenough for Mr. Casaubon. Before he left the next day it had been\ndecided that the marriage should take place within six weeks. Why not?\nMr. Casaubon’s house was ready. It was not a parsonage, but a\nconsiderable mansion, with much land attached to it. The parsonage was\ninhabited by the curate, who did all the duty except preaching the\nmorning sermon.CHAPTER VI.My lady’s tongue is like the meadow blades,\nThat cut you stroking them with idle hand.\nNice cutting is her function: she divides\nWith spiritual edge the millet-seed,\nAnd makes intangible savings.As Mr. Casaubon’s carriage was passing out of the gateway, it arrested\nthe entrance of a pony phaeton driven by a lady with a servant seated\nbehind. It was doubtful whether the recognition had been mutual, for\nMr. Casaubon was looking absently before him; but the lady was\nquick-eyed, and threw a nod and a “How do you do?” in the nick of time.\nIn spite of her shabby bonnet and very old Indian shawl, it was plain\nthat the lodge-keeper regarded her as an important personage, from the\nlow curtsy which was dropped on the entrance of the small phaeton.“Well, Mrs. Fitchett, how are your fowls laying now?” said the\nhigh-colored, dark-eyed lady, with the clearest chiselled utterance.“Pretty well for laying, madam, but they’ve ta’en to eating their eggs:\nI’ve no peace o’ mind with ’em at all.”“Oh, the cannibals! Better sell them cheap at once. What will you sell\nthem a couple? One can’t eat fowls of a bad character at a high price.”“Well, madam, half-a-crown: I couldn’t let ’em go, not under.”“Half-a-crown, these times! Come now—for the Rector’s chicken-broth on\na Sunday. He has consumed all ours that I can spare. You are half paid\nwith the sermon, Mrs. Fitchett, remember that. Take a pair of\ntumbler-pigeons for them—little beauties. You must come and see them.\nYou have no tumblers among your pigeons.”“Well, madam, Master Fitchett shall go and see ’em after work. He’s\nvery hot on new sorts; to oblige you.”“Oblige me! It will be the best bargain he ever made. A pair of church\npigeons for a couple of wicked Spanish fowls that eat their own eggs!\nDon’t you and Fitchett boast too much, that is all!”"

  "content": "The phaeton was driven onwards with the last words, leaving Mrs.\nFitchett laughing and shaking her head slowly, with an interjectional\n“Sure_ly_, sure_ly_!”—from which it might be inferred that she would\nhave found the country-side somewhat duller if the Rector’s lady had\nbeen less free-spoken and less of a skinflint. Indeed, both the farmers\nand laborers in the parishes of Freshitt and Tipton would have felt a\nsad lack of conversation but for the stories about what Mrs.\nCadwallader said and did: a lady of immeasurably high birth, descended,\nas it were, from unknown earls, dim as the crowd of heroic shades—who\npleaded poverty, pared down prices, and cut jokes in the most\ncompanionable manner, though with a turn of tongue that let you know\nwho she was. Such a lady gave a neighborliness to both rank and\nreligion, and mitigated the bitterness of uncommuted tithe. A much more\nexemplary character with an infusion of sour dignity would not have\nfurthered their comprehension of the Thirty-nine Articles, and would\nhave been less socially uniting.Mr. Brooke, seeing Mrs. Cadwallader’s merits from a different point of\nview, winced a little when her name was announced in the library, where\nhe was sitting alone.“I see you have had our Lowick Cicero here,” she said, seating herself\ncomfortably, throwing back her wraps, and showing a thin but well-built\nfigure. “I suspect you and he are brewing some bad polities, else you\nwould not be seeing so much of the lively man. I shall inform against\nyou: remember you are both suspicious characters since you took Peel’s\nside about the Catholic Bill. I shall tell everybody that you are going\nto put up for Middlemarch on the Whig side when old Pinkerton resigns,\nand that Casaubon is going to help you in an underhand manner: going to\nbribe the voters with pamphlets, and throw open the public-houses to\ndistribute them. Come, confess!”“Nothing of the sort,” said Mr. Brooke, smiling and rubbing his\neye-glasses, but really blushing a little at the impeachment. “Casaubon\nand I don’t talk politics much. He doesn’t care much about the\nphilanthropic side of things; punishments, and that kind of thing. He\nonly cares about Church questions. That is not my line of action, you\nknow.”“Ra-a-ther too much, my friend. I have heard of your doings. Who was it\nthat sold his bit of land to the Papists at Middlemarch? I believe you\nbought it on purpose. You are a perfect Guy Faux. See if you are not\nburnt in effigy this 5th of November coming. Humphrey would not come to\nquarrel with you about it, so I am come.”“Very good. I was prepared to be persecuted for not persecuting—not\npersecuting, you know.”"

A man always makes a fool of himself, speechifying: there’s no\nexcuse but being on the right side, so that you can ask a blessing on\nyour humming and hawing. You will lose yourself, I forewarn you. You\nwill make a Saturday pie of all parties’ opinions, and be pelted by\neverybody.”“That is what I expect, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, not wishing to\nbetray how little he enjoyed this prophetic sketch—“what I expect as an\nindependent man. As to the Whigs, a man who goes with the thinkers is\nnot likely to be hooked on by any party. He may go with them up to a\ncertain point—up to a certain point, you know. But that is what you\nladies never understand.”“Where your certain point is? No. I should like to be told how a man\ncan have any certain point when he belongs to no party—leading a roving\nlife, and never letting his friends know his address. ‘Nobody knows\nwhere Brooke will be—there’s no counting on Brooke’—that is what people\nsay of you, to be quite frank. Now, do turn respectable. How will you\nlike going to Sessions with everybody looking shy on you, and you with\na bad conscience and an empty pocket?”“I don’t pretend to argue with a lady on politics,” said Mr. Brooke,\nwith an air of smiling indifference, but feeling rather unpleasantly\nconscious that this attack of Mrs. Cadwallader’s had opened the\ndefensive campaign to which certain rash steps had exposed him. “Your\nsex are not thinkers, you know—_varium et mutabile semper_—that kind of\nthing. You don’t know Virgil. I knew”—Mr. Brooke reflected in time that\nhe had not had the personal acquaintance of the Augustan poet—“I was\ngoing to say, poor Stoddart, you know. That was what _he_ said. You\nladies are always against an independent attitude—a man’s caring for\nnothing but truth, and that sort of thing. And there is no part of the\ncounty where opinion is narrower than it is here—I don’t mean to throw\nstones, you know, but somebody is wanted to take the independent line;\nand if I don’t take it, who will?”"

And you! who are going to marry your niece, as good as your\ndaughter, to one of our best men. Sir James would be cruelly annoyed:\nit will be too hard on him if you turn round now and make yourself a\nWhig sign-board.”Mr. Brooke again winced inwardly, for Dorothea’s engagement had no\nsooner been decided, than he had thought of Mrs. Cadwallader’s\nprospective taunts. It might have been easy for ignorant observers to\nsay, “Quarrel with Mrs. Cadwallader;” but where is a country gentleman\nto go who quarrels with his oldest neighbors? Who could taste the fine\nflavor in the name of Brooke if it were delivered casually, like wine\nwithout a seal? Certainly a man can only be cosmopolitan up to a\ncertain point.“I hope Chettam and I shall always be good friends; but I am sorry to\nsay there is no prospect of his marrying my niece,” said Mr. Brooke,\nmuch relieved to see through the window that Celia was coming in.“Why not?” said Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharp note of surprise. “It is\nhardly a fortnight since you and I were talking about it.”“My niece has chosen another suitor—has chosen him, you know. I have\nhad nothing to do with it. I should have preferred Chettam; and I\nshould have said Chettam was the man any girl would have chosen. But\nthere is no accounting for these things. Your sex is capricious, you\nknow.”“Why, whom do you mean to say that you are going to let her marry?”\nMrs. Cadwallader’s mind was rapidly surveying the possibilities of\nchoice for Dorothea.But here Celia entered, blooming from a walk in the garden, and the\ngreeting with her delivered Mr. Brooke from the necessity of answering\nimmediately. He got up hastily, and saying, “By the way, I must speak\nto Wright about the horses,” shuffled quickly out of the room.“My dear child, what is this?—this about your sister’s engagement?”\nsaid Mrs. Cadwallader.“She is engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon,” said Celia, resorting, as\nusual, to the simplest statement of fact, and enjoying this opportunity\nof speaking to the Rector’s wife alone.“This is frightful. How long has it been going on?”“I only knew of it yesterday. They are to be married in six weeks.”“Well, my dear, I wish you joy of your brother-in-law.”“I am so sorry for Dorothea.”"

It is her doing, I suppose.”“Yes; she says Mr. Casaubon has a great soul.”“With all my heart.”“Oh, Mrs. Cadwallader, I don’t think it can be nice to marry a man with\na great soul.”“Well, my dear, take warning. You know the look of one now; when the\nnext comes and wants to marry you, don’t you accept him.”“I’m sure I never should.”“No; one such in a family is enough. So your sister never cared about\nSir James Chettam? What would you have said to _him_ for a\nbrother-in-law?”“I should have liked that very much. I am sure he would have been a\ngood husband. Only,” Celia added, with a slight blush (she sometimes\nseemed to blush as she breathed), “I don’t think he would have suited\nDorothea.”“Not high-flown enough?”“Dodo is very strict. She thinks so much about everything, and is so\nparticular about what one says. Sir James never seemed to please her.”“She must have encouraged him, I am sure. That is not very creditable.”“Please don’t be angry with Dodo; she does not see things. She thought\nso much about the cottages, and she was rude to Sir James sometimes;\nbut he is so kind, he never noticed it.”"

  "content": "“Well,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, putting on her shawl, and rising, as if\nin haste, “I must go straight to Sir James and break this to him. He\nwill have brought his mother back by this time, and I must call. Your\nuncle will never tell him. We are all disappointed, my dear. Young\npeople should think of their families in marrying. I set a bad\nexample—married a poor clergyman, and made myself a pitiable object\namong the De Bracys—obliged to get my coals by stratagem, and pray to\nheaven for my salad oil. However, Casaubon has money enough; I must do\nhim that justice. As to his blood, I suppose the family quarterings are\nthree cuttle-fish sable, and a commentator rampant. By the bye, before\nI go, my dear, I must speak to your Mrs. Carter about pastry. I want to\nsend my young cook to learn of her. Poor people with four children,\nlike us, you know, can’t afford to keep a good cook. I have no doubt\nMrs. Carter will oblige me. Sir James’s cook is a perfect dragon.”In less than an hour, Mrs. Cadwallader had circumvented Mrs. Carter and\ndriven to Freshitt Hall, which was not far from her own parsonage, her\nhusband being resident in Freshitt and keeping a curate in Tipton.Sir James Chettam had returned from the short journey which had kept\nhim absent for a couple of days, and had changed his dress, intending\nto ride over to Tipton Grange. His horse was standing at the door when\nMrs. Cadwallader drove up, and he immediately appeared there himself,\nwhip in hand. Lady Chettam had not yet returned, but Mrs. Cadwallader’s\nerrand could not be despatched in the presence of grooms, so she asked\nto be taken into the conservatory close by, to look at the new plants;\nand on coming to a contemplative stand, she said—“I have a great shock for you; I hope you are not so far gone in love\nas you pretended to be.”It was of no use protesting against Mrs. Cadwallader’s way of putting\nthings. But Sir James’s countenance changed a little. He felt a vague\nalarm.“I do believe Brooke is going to expose himself after all. I accused\nhim of meaning to stand for Middlemarch on the Liberal side, and he\nlooked silly and never denied it—talked about the independent line, and\nthe usual nonsense.”“Is that all?” said Sir James, much relieved.“Why,” rejoined Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharper note, “you don’t mean\nto say that you would like him to turn public man in that way—making a\nsort of political Cheap Jack of himself?”“He might be dissuaded, I should think. He would not like the expense.”“That is what I told him. He is vulnerable to reason there—always a few\ngrains of common-sense in an ounce of miserliness. Miserliness is a\ncapital quality to run in families; it’s the safe side for madness to\ndip on. And there must be a little crack in the Brooke family, else we\nshould not see what we are to see.”“What? Brooke standing for Middlemarch?”"

I knew there was a great deal\nof nonsense in her—a flighty sort of Methodistical stuff. But these\nthings wear out of girls. However, I am taken by surprise for once.”“What do you mean, Mrs. Cadwallader?” said Sir James. His fear lest\nMiss Brooke should have run away to join the Moravian Brethren, or some\npreposterous sect unknown to good society, was a little allayed by the\nknowledge that Mrs. Cadwallader always made the worst of things. “What\nhas happened to Miss Brooke? Pray speak out.”“Very well. She is engaged to be married.” Mrs. Cadwallader paused a\nfew moments, observing the deeply hurt expression in her friend’s face,\nwhich he was trying to conceal by a nervous smile, while he whipped his\nboot; but she soon added, “Engaged to Casaubon.”Sir James let his whip fall and stooped to pick it up. Perhaps his face\nhad never before gathered so much concentrated disgust as when he\nturned to Mrs. Cadwallader and repeated, “Casaubon?”“Even so. You know my errand now.”“Good God! It is horrible! He is no better than a mummy!” (The point of\nview has to be allowed for, as that of a blooming and disappointed\nrival.)“She says, he is a great soul.—A great bladder for dried peas to rattle\nin!” said Mrs. Cadwallader.“What business has an old bachelor like that to marry?” said Sir James.\n“He has one foot in the grave.”“He means to draw it out again, I suppose.”“Brooke ought not to allow it: he should insist on its being put off\ntill she is of age. She would think better of it then. What is a\nguardian for?”“As if you could ever squeeze a resolution out of Brooke!”“Cadwallader might talk to him.”"

He will even speak well of the bishop, though I tell\nhim it is unnatural in a beneficed clergyman; what can one do with a\nhusband who attends so little to the decencies? I hide it as well as I\ncan by abusing everybody myself. Come, come, cheer up! you are well rid\nof Miss Brooke, a girl who would have been requiring you to see the\nstars by daylight. Between ourselves, little Celia is worth two of her,\nand likely after all to be the better match. For this marriage to\nCasaubon is as good as going to a nunnery.”“Oh, on my own account—it is for Miss Brooke’s sake I think her friends\nshould try to use their influence.”“Well, Humphrey doesn’t know yet. But when I tell him, you may depend\non it he will say, ‘Why not? Casaubon is a good fellow—and young—young\nenough.’ These charitable people never know vinegar from wine till they\nhave swallowed it and got the colic.

I can see that she admires\nyou almost as much as a man expects to be admired. If it were any one\nbut me who said so, you might think it exaggeration. Good-by!”Sir James handed Mrs. Cadwallader to the phaeton, and then jumped on\nhis horse.

  "content": "Now, why on earth should Mrs. Cadwallader have been at all busy about\nMiss Brooke’s marriage; and why, when one match that she liked to think\nshe had a hand in was frustrated, should she have straightway contrived\nthe preliminaries of another? Was there any ingenious plot, any\nhide-and-seek course of action, which might be detected by a careful\ntelescopic watch? Not at all: a telescope might have swept the parishes\nof Tipton and Freshitt, the whole area visited by Mrs. Cadwallader in\nher phaeton, without witnessing any interview that could excite\nsuspicion, or any scene from which she did not return with the same\nunperturbed keenness of eye and the same high natural color. In fact,\nif that convenient vehicle had existed in the days of the Seven Sages,\none of them would doubtless have remarked, that you can know little of\nwomen by following them about in their pony-phaetons. Even with a\nmicroscope directed on a water-drop we find ourselves making\ninterpretations which turn out to be rather coarse; for whereas under a\nweak lens you may seem to see a creature exhibiting an active voracity\ninto which other smaller creatures actively play as if they were so\nmany animated tax-pennies, a stronger lens reveals to you certain\ntiniest hairlets which make vortices for these victims while the\nswallower waits passively at his receipt of custom. In this way,\nmetaphorically speaking, a strong lens applied to Mrs. Cadwallader’s\nmatch-making will show a play of minute causes producing what may be\ncalled thought and speech vortices to bring her the sort of food she\nneeded. Her life was rurally simple, quite free from secrets either\nfoul, dangerous, or otherwise important, and not consciously affected\nby the great affairs of the world. All the more did the affairs of the\ngreat world interest her, when communicated in the letters of high-born\nrelations: the way in which fascinating younger sons had gone to the\ndogs by marrying their mistresses; the fine old-blooded idiocy of young\nLord Tapir, and the furious gouty humors of old Lord Megatherium; the\nexact crossing of genealogies which had brought a coronet into a new\nbranch and widened the relations of scandal,—these were topics of which\nshe retained details with the utmost accuracy, and reproduced them in\nan excellent pickle of epigrams, which she herself enjoyed the more\nbecause she believed as unquestionably in birth and no-birth as she did\nin game and vermin. She would never have disowned any one on the ground\nof poverty: a De Bracy reduced to take his dinner in a basin would have\nseemed to her an example of pathos worth exaggerating, and I fear his\naristocratic vices would not have horrified her. But her feeling\ntowards the vulgar rich was a sort of religious hatred: they had\nprobably made all their money out of high retail prices, and Mrs.\nCadwallader detested high prices for everything that was not paid in\nkind at the Rectory: such people were no part of God’s design in making\nthe world; and their accent was an affliction to the ears. A town where\nsuch monsters abounded was hardly more than a sort of low comedy, which\ncould not be taken account of in a well-bred scheme of the universe.\nLet any lady who is inclined to be hard on Mrs. Cadwallader inquire\ninto the comprehensiveness of her own beautiful views, and be quite\nsure that they afford accommodation for all the lives which have the\nhonor to coexist with hers."

From the first arrival of the\nyoung ladies in Tipton she had prearranged Dorothea’s marriage with Sir\nJames, and if it had taken place would have been quite sure that it was\nher doing: that it should not take place after she had preconceived it,\ncaused her an irritation which every thinker will sympathize with. She\nwas the diplomatist of Tipton and Freshitt, and for anything to happen\nin spite of her was an offensive irregularity. As to freaks like this\nof Miss Brooke’s, Mrs. Cadwallader had no patience with them, and now\nsaw that her opinion of this girl had been infected with some of her\nhusband’s weak charitableness: those Methodistical whims, that air of\nbeing more religious than the rector and curate together, came from a\ndeeper and more constitutional disease than she had been willing to\nbelieve.“However,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, first to herself and afterwards to\nher husband, “I throw her over: there was a chance, if she had married\nSir James, of her becoming a sane, sensible woman.

For he was not one of those gentlemen who\nlanguish after the unattainable Sappho’s apple that laughs from the\ntopmost bough—the charms which“Smile like the knot of cowslips on the cliff,\nNot to be come at by the willing hand.”He had no sonnets to write, and it could not strike him agreeably that\nhe was not an object of preference to the woman whom he had preferred.\nAlready the knowledge that Dorothea had chosen Mr. Casaubon had bruised\nhis attachment and relaxed its hold. Although Sir James was a\nsportsman, he had some other feelings towards women than towards grouse\nand foxes, and did not regard his future wife in the light of prey,\nvaluable chiefly for the excitements of the chase. Neither was he so\nwell acquainted with the habits of primitive races as to feel that an\nideal combat for her, tomahawk in hand, so to speak, was necessary to\nthe historical continuity of the marriage-tie. On the contrary, having\nthe amiable vanity which knits us to those who are fond of us, and\ndisinclines us to those who are indifferent, and also a good grateful\nnature, the mere idea that a woman had a kindness towards him spun\nlittle threads of tenderness from out his heart towards hers."

  "content": "Thus it happened, that after Sir James had ridden rather fast for half\nan hour in a direction away from Tipton Grange, he slackened his pace,\nand at last turned into a road which would lead him back by a shorter\ncut. Various feelings wrought in him the determination after all to go\nto the Grange to-day as if nothing new had happened. He could not help\nrejoicing that he had never made the offer and been rejected; mere\nfriendly politeness required that he should call to see Dorothea about\nthe cottages, and now happily Mrs. Cadwallader had prepared him to\noffer his congratulations, if necessary, without showing too much\nawkwardness. He really did not like it: giving up Dorothea was very\npainful to him; but there was something in the resolve to make this\nvisit forthwith and conquer all show of feeling, which was a sort of\nfile-biting and counter-irritant. And without his distinctly\nrecognizing the impulse, there certainly was present in him the sense\nthat Celia would be there, and that he should pay her more attention\nthan he had done before.We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between\nbreakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale\nabout the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, “Oh, nothing!” Pride\nhelps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide\nour own hurts—not to hurt others.CHAPTER VII.“Piacer e popone\nVuol la sua stagione.”\n—_Italian Proverb_.Mr. Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his time at\nthe Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which courtship occasioned\nto the progress of his great work—the Key to all Mythologies—naturally\nmade him look forward the more eagerly to the happy termination of\ncourtship. But he had deliberately incurred the hindrance, having made\nup his mind that it was now time for him to adorn his life with the\ngraces of female companionship, to irradiate the gloom which fatigue\nwas apt to hang over the intervals of studious labor with the play of\nfemale fancy, and to secure in this, his culminating age, the solace of\nfemale tendance for his declining years. Hence he determined to abandon\nhimself to the stream of feeling, and perhaps was surprised to find\nwhat an exceedingly shallow rill it was. As in droughty regions baptism\nby immersion could only be performed symbolically, Mr. Casaubon found\nthat sprinkling was the utmost approach to a plunge which his stream\nwould afford him; and he concluded that the poets had much exaggerated\nthe force of masculine passion. Nevertheless, he observed with pleasure\nthat Miss Brooke showed an ardent submissive affection which promised\nto fulfil his most agreeable previsions of marriage. It had once or\ntwice crossed his mind that possibly there was some deficiency in\nDorothea to account for the moderation of his abandonment; but he was\nunable to discern the deficiency, or to figure to himself a woman who\nwould have pleased him better; so that there was clearly no reason to\nfall back upon but the exaggerations of human tradition."

I\nhope you don’t expect me to be naughty and stupid?”“I expect you to be all that an exquisite young lady can be in every\npossible relation of life. Certainly it might be a great advantage if\nyou were able to copy the Greek character, and to that end it were well\nto begin with a little reading.”"

  "content": "Dorothea seized this as a precious permission. She would not have asked\nMr. Casaubon at once to teach her the languages, dreading of all things\nto be tiresome instead of helpful; but it was not entirely out of\ndevotion to her future husband that she wished to know Latin and Greek.\nThose provinces of masculine knowledge seemed to her a standing-ground\nfrom which all truth could be seen more truly. As it was, she\nconstantly doubted her own conclusions, because she felt her own\nignorance: how could she be confident that one-roomed cottages were not\nfor the glory of God, when men who knew the classics appeared to\nconciliate indifference to the cottages with zeal for the glory?\nPerhaps even Hebrew might be necessary—at least the alphabet and a few\nroots—in order to arrive at the core of things, and judge soundly on\nthe social duties of the Christian. And she had not reached that point\nof renunciation at which she would have been satisfied with having a\nwise husband: she wished, poor child, to be wise herself. Miss Brooke\nwas certainly very naive with all her alleged cleverness. Celia, whose\nmind had never been thought too powerful, saw the emptiness of other\npeople’s pretensions much more readily. To have in general but little\nfeeling, seems to be the only security against feeling too much on any\nparticular occasion.However, Mr. Casaubon consented to listen and teach for an hour\ntogether, like a schoolmaster of little boys, or rather like a lover,\nto whom a mistress’s elementary ignorance and difficulties have a\ntouching fitness. Few scholars would have disliked teaching the\nalphabet under such circumstances. But Dorothea herself was a little\nshocked and discouraged at her own stupidity, and the answers she got\nto some timid questions about the value of the Greek accents gave her a\npainful suspicion that here indeed there might be secrets not capable\nof explanation to a woman’s reason.Mr. Brooke had no doubt on that point, and expressed himself with his\nusual strength upon it one day that he came into the library while the\nreading was going forward.“Well, but now, Casaubon, such deep studies, classics, mathematics,\nthat kind of thing, are too taxing for a woman—too taxing, you know.”“Dorothea is learning to read the characters simply,” said Mr.\nCasaubon, evading the question. “She had the very considerate thought\nof saving my eyes.”“Ah, well, without understanding, you know—that may not be so bad. But\nthere is a lightness about the feminine mind—a touch and go—music, the\nfine arts, that kind of thing—they should study those up to a certain\npoint, women should; but in a light way, you know. A woman should be\nable to sit down and play you or sing you a good old English tune. That\nis what I like; though I have heard most things—been at the opera in\nVienna: Gluck, Mozart, everything of that sort. But I’m a conservative\nin music—it’s not like ideas, you know. I stick to the good old tunes.”"

She smiled and\nlooked up at her betrothed with grateful eyes. If he had always been\nasking her to play the “Last Rose of Summer,” she would have required\nmuch resignation. “He says there is only an old harpsichord at Lowick,\nand it is covered with books.”“Ah, there you are behind Celia, my dear. Celia, now, plays very\nprettily, and is always ready to play. However, since Casaubon does not\nlike it, you are all right. But it’s a pity you should not have little\nrecreations of that sort, Casaubon: the bow always strung—that kind of\nthing, you know—will not do.”“I never could look on it in the light of a recreation to have my ears\nteased with measured noises,” said Mr. Casaubon. “A tune much iterated\nhas the ridiculous effect of making the words in my mind perform a sort\nof minuet to keep time—an effect hardly tolerable, I imagine, after\nboyhood. As to the grander forms of music, worthy to accompany solemn\ncelebrations, and even to serve as an educating influence according to\nthe ancient conception, I say nothing, for with these we are not\nimmediately concerned.”“No; but music of that sort I should enjoy,” said Dorothea. “When we\nwere coming home from Lausanne my uncle took us to hear the great organ\nat Freiberg, and it made me sob.”“That kind of thing is not healthy, my dear,” said Mr. Brooke.\n“Casaubon, she will be in your hands now: you must teach my niece to\ntake things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?”He ended with a smile, not wishing to hurt his niece, but really\nthinking that it was perhaps better for her to be early married to so\nsober a fellow as Casaubon, since she would not hear of Chettam.“It is wonderful, though,” he said to himself as he shuffled out of the\nroom—“it is wonderful that she should have liked him. However, the\nmatch is good. I should have been travelling out of my brief to have\nhindered it, let Mrs. Cadwallader say what she will. He is pretty\ncertain to be a bishop, is Casaubon. That was a very seasonable\npamphlet of his on the Catholic Question:—a deanery at least. They owe\nhim a deanery.”"

  "content": "And here I must vindicate a claim to philosophical reflectiveness, by\nremarking that Mr. Brooke on this occasion little thought of the\nRadical speech which, at a later period, he was led to make on the\nincomes of the bishops. What elegant historian would neglect a striking\nopportunity for pointing out that his heroes did not foresee the\nhistory of the world, or even their own actions?—For example, that\nHenry of Navarre, when a Protestant baby, little thought of being a\nCatholic monarch; or that Alfred the Great, when he measured his\nlaborious nights with burning candles, had no idea of future gentlemen\nmeasuring their idle days with watches. Here is a mine of truth, which,\nhowever vigorously it may be worked, is likely to outlast our coal.But of Mr. Brooke I make a further remark perhaps less warranted by\nprecedent—namely, that if he had foreknown his speech, it might not\nhave made any great difference. To think with pleasure of his niece’s\nhusband having a large ecclesiastical income was one thing—to make a\nLiberal speech was another thing; and it is a narrow mind which cannot\nlook at a subject from various points of view.CHAPTER VIII.“Oh, rescue her! I am her brother now,\nAnd you her father. Every gentle maid\nShould have a guardian in each gentleman.”It was wonderful to Sir James Chettam how well he continued to like\ngoing to the Grange after he had once encountered the difficulty of\nseeing Dorothea for the first time in the light of a woman who was\nengaged to another man. Of course the forked lightning seemed to pass\nthrough him when he first approached her, and he remained conscious\nthroughout the interview of hiding uneasiness; but, good as he was, it\nmust be owned that his uneasiness was less than it would have been if\nhe had thought his rival a brilliant and desirable match. He had no\nsense of being eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; he was only shocked that\nDorothea was under a melancholy illusion, and his mortification lost\nsome of its bitterness by being mingled with compassion."

  "content": "Nevertheless, while Sir James said to himself that he had completely\nresigned her, since with the perversity of a Desdemona she had not\naffected a proposed match that was clearly suitable and according to\nnature; he could not yet be quite passive under the idea of her\nengagement to Mr. Casaubon. On the day when he first saw them together\nin the light of his present knowledge, it seemed to him that he had not\ntaken the affair seriously enough. Brooke was really culpable; he ought\nto have hindered it. Who could speak to him? Something might be done\nperhaps even now, at least to defer the marriage. On his way home he\nturned into the Rectory and asked for Mr. Cadwallader. Happily, the\nRector was at home, and his visitor was shown into the study, where all\nthe fishing tackle hung. But he himself was in a little room adjoining,\nat work with his turning apparatus, and he called to the baronet to\njoin him there. The two were better friends than any other landholder\nand clergyman in the county—a significant fact which was in agreement\nwith the amiable expression of their faces.Mr. Cadwallader was a large man, with full lips and a sweet smile; very\nplain and rough in his exterior, but with that solid imperturbable ease\nand good-humor which is infectious, and like great grassy hills in the\nsunshine, quiets even an irritated egoism, and makes it rather ashamed\nof itself. “Well, how are you?” he said, showing a hand not quite fit\nto be grasped. “Sorry I missed you before. Is there anything\nparticular? You look vexed.”Sir James’s brow had a little crease in it, a little depression of the\neyebrow, which he seemed purposely to exaggerate as he answered.“It is only this conduct of Brooke’s. I really think somebody should\nspeak to him.”“What? meaning to stand?” said Mr. Cadwallader, going on with the\narrangement of the reels which he had just been turning. “I hardly\nthink he means it. But where’s the harm, if he likes it? Any one who\nobjects to Whiggery should be glad when the Whigs don’t put up the\nstrongest fellow. They won’t overturn the Constitution with our friend\nBrooke’s head for a battering ram.”“Oh, I don’t mean that,” said Sir James, who, after putting down his\nhat and throwing himself into a chair, had begun to nurse his leg and\nexamine the sole of his boot with much bitterness. “I mean this\nmarriage. I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon.”“What is the matter with Casaubon? I see no harm in him—if the girl\nlikes him.”“She is too young to know what she likes. Her guardian ought to\ninterfere. He ought not to allow the thing to be done in this headlong\nmanner. I wonder a man like you, Cadwallader—a man with daughters, can\nlook at the affair with indifference: and with such a heart as yours!\nDo think seriously about it.”“I am not joking; I am as serious as possible,” said the Rector, with a\nprovoking little inward laugh. “You are as bad as Elinor. She has been\nwanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have reminded her that her\nfriends had a very poor opinion of the match she made when she married\nme.”"

Look at his legs!”“Confound you handsome young fellows! you think of having it all your\nown way in the world. You don’t understand women. They don’t admire you\nhalf so much as you admire yourselves. Elinor used to tell her sisters\nthat she married me for my ugliness—it was so various and amusing that\nit had quite conquered her prudence.”“You! it was easy enough for a woman to love you. But this is no\nquestion of beauty. I don’t _like_ Casaubon.” This was Sir James’s\nstrongest way of implying that he thought ill of a man’s character.“Why? what do you know against him?” said the Rector laying down his\nreels, and putting his thumbs into his armholes with an air of\nattention.Sir James paused. He did not usually find it easy to give his reasons:\nit seemed to him strange that people should not know them without being\ntold, since he only felt what was reasonable. At last he said—“Now, Cadwallader, has he got any heart?”“Well, yes. I don’t mean of the melting sort, but a sound kernel,\n_that_ you may be sure of. He is very good to his poor relations:\npensions several of the women, and is educating a young fellow at a\ngood deal of expense. Casaubon acts up to his sense of justice. His\nmother’s sister made a bad match—a Pole, I think—lost herself—at any\nrate was disowned by her family. If it had not been for that, Casaubon\nwould not have had so much money by half. I believe he went himself to\nfind out his cousins, and see what he could do for them. Every man\nwould not ring so well as that, if you tried his metal. _You_ would,\nChettam; but not every man.”"

But a man may wish to do what is right, and yet be a\nsort of parchment code. A woman may not be happy with him. And I think\nwhen a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is, her friends ought to\ninterfere a little to hinder her from doing anything foolish. You\nlaugh, because you fancy I have some feeling on my own account. But\nupon my honor, it is not that. I should feel just the same if I were\nMiss Brooke’s brother or uncle.”“Well, but what should you do?”“I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until she was of\nage. And depend upon it, in that case, it would never come off. I wish\nyou saw it as I do—I wish you would talk to Brooke about it.”Sir James rose as he was finishing his sentence, for he saw Mrs.\nCadwallader entering from the study. She held by the hand her youngest\ngirl, about five years old, who immediately ran to papa, and was made\ncomfortable on his knee.“I hear what you are talking about,” said the wife. “But you will make\nno impression on Humphrey. As long as the fish rise to his bait,\neverybody is what he ought to be. Bless you, Casaubon has got a\ntrout-stream, and does not care about fishing in it himself: could\nthere be a better fellow?”“Well, there is something in that,” said the Rector, with his quiet,\ninward laugh. “It is a very good quality in a man to have a\ntrout-stream.”“But seriously,” said Sir James, whose vexation had not yet spent\nitself, “don’t you think the Rector might do some good by speaking?”“Oh, I told you beforehand what he would say,” answered Mrs.\nCadwallader, lifting up her eyebrows. “I have done what I could: I wash\nmy hands of the marriage.”“In the first place,” said the Rector, looking rather grave, “it would\nbe nonsensical to expect that I could convince Brooke, and make him act\naccordingly. Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; he will run into\nany mould, but he won’t keep shape.”“He might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage,” said Sir\nJames."

As to the line he took on the\nCatholic Question, that was unexpected; but he has always been civil to\nme, and I don’t see why I should spoil his sport. For anything I can\ntell, Miss Brooke may be happier with him than she would be with any\nother man.”“Humphrey! I have no patience with you.

She does not do\nit for my amusement.”“He has got no good red blood in his body,” said Sir James.“No. Somebody put a drop under a magnifying-glass and it was all\nsemicolons and parentheses,” said Mrs. Cadwallader.“Why does he not bring out his book, instead of marrying,” said Sir\nJames, with a disgust which he held warranted by the sound feeling of\nan English layman.“Oh, he dreams footnotes, and they run away with all his brains. They\nsay, when he was a little boy, he made an abstract of ‘Hop o’ my\nThumb,’ and he has been making abstracts ever since. Ugh!

She is _not_ my daughter, and I\ndon’t feel called upon to interfere. Casaubon is as good as most of us.\nHe is a scholarly clergyman, and creditable to the cloth. Some Radical\nfellow speechifying at Middlemarch said Casaubon was the learned\nstraw-chopping incumbent, and Freke was the brick-and-mortar incumbent,\nand I was the angling incumbent. And upon my word, I don’t see that one\nis worse or better than the other.” The Rector ended with his silent\nlaugh. He always saw the joke of any satire against himself.

It was a sign of his good\ndisposition that he did not slacken at all in his intention of carrying\nout Dorothea’s design of the cottages. Doubtless this persistence was\nthe best course for his own dignity: but pride only helps us to be\ngenerous; it never makes us so, any more than vanity makes us witty.\nShe was now enough aware of Sir James’s position with regard to her, to\nappreciate the rectitude of his perseverance in a landlord’s duty, to\nwhich he had at first been urged by a lover’s complaisance, and her\npleasure in it was great enough to count for something even in her\npresent happiness. Perhaps she gave to Sir James Chettam’s cottages all\nthe interest she could spare from Mr. Casaubon, or rather from the\nsymphony of hopeful dreams, admiring trust, and passionate self\ndevotion which that learned gentleman had set playing in her soul.\nHence it happened that in the good baronet’s succeeding visits, while\nhe was beginning to pay small attentions to Celia, he found himself\ntalking with more and more pleasure to Dorothea. She was perfectly\nunconstrained and without irritation towards him now, and he was\ngradually discovering the delight there is in frank kindness and\ncompanionship between a man and a woman who have no passion to hide or\nconfess.CHAPTER IX.1_st Gent_.

The betrothed bride must see her\nfuture home, and dictate any changes that she would like to have made\nthere. A woman dictates before marriage in order that she may have an\nappetite for submission afterwards. And certainly, the mistakes that we\nmale and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly\nraise some wonder that we are so fond of it."
