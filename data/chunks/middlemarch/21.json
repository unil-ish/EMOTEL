  "content": "The grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of\nher pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her\njudgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of\nfaithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her judgment, instead of\nbeing controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the\nimbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the\nhidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man\nwas no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only the\nretrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been\nlower than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had\neven blinded his scrupulous care for his own character, and made him\ndefeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the\nproperty which was the sign of that broken tie, she would have been\nglad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune\nwhich had been settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to\nownership, which she ought not to flinch from. About this property many\ntroublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in\nthinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it\nnot impossible now for her to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had\ntaken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation\nagainst him in her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of\nhis purpose revolted her.After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she\nlocked up again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal words for\nher—empty of any sign that in her husband’s lonely brooding his heart\nhad gone out to her in excuse or explanation; and she went back to\nFreshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last\ninjurious assertion of his power, the silence was unbroken.Dorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties, and\none of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her\nof. Lydgate’s ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, and as\nsoon as he could, he reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of\nmaking amends for the casting-vote he had once given with an\nill-satisfied conscience. “Instead of telling you anything about Mr.\nTyke,” he said, “I should like to speak of another man—Mr. Farebrother,\nthe Vicar of St. Botolph’s. His living is a poor one, and gives him a\nstinted provision for himself and his family. His mother, aunt, and\nsister all live with him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never\nmarried because of them. I never heard such good preaching as his—such\nplain, easy eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul’s Cross\nafter old Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects:\noriginal, simple, clear. I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to\nhave done more than he has done.”“Why has he not done more?” said Dorothea, interested now in all who\nhad slipped below their own intention."

  "content": "“That’s a hard question,” said Lydgate. “I find myself that it’s\nuncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many\nstrings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that he has got into\nthe wrong profession; he wants a wider range than that of a poor\nclergyman, and I suppose he has no interest to help him on. He is very\nfond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he is\nhampered in reconciling these tastes with his position. He has no money\nto spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him into\ncard-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does play for\nmoney, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him into company a\nlittle beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet,\nwith all that, looking at him as a whole, I think he is one of the most\nblameless men I ever knew. He has neither venom nor doubleness in him,\nand those often go with a more correct outside.”“I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that habit,”\nsaid Dorothea; “I wonder whether he wishes he could leave it off.”“I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted into\nplenty: he would be glad of the time for other things.”“My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,” said\nDorothea, meditatively. She was wishing it were possible to restore the\ntimes of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a\nstrong desire to rescue him from his chance-gotten money.“I don’t pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said Lydgate.\n“His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a\nparson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.\nPractically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an\nimpatience of everything in which the parson doesn’t cut the principal\nfigure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good\ndeal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people\nuncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!—he\nought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the\nbirds.”“True,” said Dorothea. “It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our\nfarmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into\na volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at\nLowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the\nApocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which\nChristianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a\nwider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest—I mean\nthat which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most\npeople as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than\nto condemn too much. But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear\nhim preach.”"

  "content": "“Do,” said Lydgate; “I trust to the effect of that. He is very much\nbeloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people who can’t\nforgive an able man for differing from them. And that money-winning\nbusiness is really a blot. You don’t, of course, see many Middlemarch\npeople: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a\ngreat friend of Mr. Farebrother’s old ladies, and would be glad to sing\nthe Vicar’s praises. One of the old ladies—Miss Noble, the aunt—is a\nwonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw\ngallants her about sometimes. I met them one day in a back street: you\nknow Ladislaw’s look—a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this\nlittle old maid reaching up to his arm—they looked like a couple\ndropped out of a romantic comedy. But the best evidence about\nFarebrother is to see him and hear him.”Happily Dorothea was in her private sitting-room when this conversation\noccurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate’s innocent\nintroduction of Ladislaw painful to her. As was usual with him in\nmatters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond’s\nremark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon. At that moment he\nwas only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and he\nhad purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the\nVicar, in order to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr.\nCasaubon’s death he had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he had heard no rumor\nto warn him that Mr. Brooke’s confidential secretary was a dangerous\nsubject with Mrs. Casaubon. When he was gone, his picture of Ladislaw\nlingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of the\nLowick living. What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her? Would he hear\nof that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do? And\nhow would he feel when he heard it?—But she could see as well as\npossible how he smiled down at the little old maid. An Italian with\nwhite mice!—on the contrary, he was a creature who entered into every\none’s feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of\nurging his own with iron resistance.CHAPTER LI.Party is Nature too, and you shall see\nBy force of Logic how they both agree:\nThe Many in the One, the One in Many;\nAll is not Some, nor Some the same as Any:\nGenus holds species, both are great or small;\nOne genus highest, one not high at all;\nEach species has its differentia too,\nThis is not That, and He was never You,\nThough this and that are AYES, and you and he\nAre like as one to one, or three to three."

  "content": "No gossip about Mr. Casaubon’s will had yet reached Ladislaw: the air\nseemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and the coming\nelection, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter\nof itinerant shows; and more private noises were taken little notice\nof. The famous “dry election” was at hand, in which the depths of\npublic feeling might be measured by the low flood-mark of drink. Will\nLadislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea’s\nwidowhood was continually in his thought, he was so far from wishing to\nbe spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him out to tell\nhim what had passed about the Lowick living, he answered rather\nwaspishly—“Why should you bring me into the matter? I never see Mrs. Casaubon,\nand am not likely to see her, since she is at Freshitt. I never go\nthere. It is Tory ground, where I and the ‘Pioneer’ are no more welcome\nthan a poacher and his gun.”The fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by observing\nthat Mr. Brooke, instead of wishing him, as before, to come to the\nGrange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself, seemed now to\ncontrive that he should go there as little as possible. This was a\nshuffling concession of Mr. Brooke’s to Sir James Chettam’s indignant\nremonstrance; and Will, awake to the slightest hint in this direction,\nconcluded that he was to be kept away from the Grange on Dorothea’s\naccount. Her friends, then, regarded him with some suspicion? Their\nfears were quite superfluous: they were very much mistaken if they\nimagined that he would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying\nto win the favor of a rich woman.Until now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself and\nDorothea—until now that he was come to the brink of it, and saw her on\nthe other side. He began, not without some inward rage, to think of\ngoing away from the neighborhood: it would be impossible for him to\nshow any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to\ndisagreeable imputations—perhaps even in her mind, which others might\ntry to poison."

  "content": "“We are forever divided,” said Will. “I might as well be at Rome; she\nwould be no farther from me.” But what we call our despair is often\nonly the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There were plenty of reasons\nwhy he should not go—public reasons why he should not quit his post at\nthis crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed “coaching”\nfor the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and\nindirect, to be carried on. Will could not like to leave his own\nchessmen in the heat of a game; and any candidate on the right side,\neven if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a\ngentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority. To coach Mr. Brooke\nand keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote\nfor the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his independence\nand power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task. Mr.\nFarebrother’s prophecy of a fourth candidate “in the bag” had not yet\nbeen fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any\nother power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy\nnodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate\nlike Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his own expense; and the\nfight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member, Bagster the\nnew Whig member returned at the last election, and Brooke the future\nindependent member, who was to fetter himself for this occasion only.\nMr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of\nPinkerton, and Mr. Brooke’s success must depend either on plumpers\nwhich would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory\nvotes into reforming votes. The latter means, of course, would be\npreferable.This prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to Mr.\nBrooke: his impression that waverers were likely to be allured by\nwavering statements, and also the liability of his mind to stick afresh\nat opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory, gave Will\nLadislaw much trouble.“You know there are tactics in these things,” said Mr. Brooke; “meeting\npeople half-way—tempering your ideas—saying, ‘Well now, there’s\nsomething in that,’ and so on. I agree with you that this is a peculiar\noccasion—the country with a will of its own—political unions—that sort\nof thing—but we sometimes cut with rather too sharp a knife, Ladislaw.\nThese ten-pound householders, now: why ten? Draw the line\nsomewhere—yes: but why just at ten? That’s a difficult question, now,\nif you go into it.”“Of course it is,” said Will, impatiently. “But if you are to wait till\nwe get a logical Bill, you must put yourself forward as a\nrevolutionist, and then Middlemarch would not elect you, I fancy. As\nfor trimming, this is not a time for trimming.”"

  "content": "Mr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, who still appeared\nto him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; but after an interval\nthe wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself, and he was again drawn\ninto using them with much hopefulness. At this stage of affairs he was\nin excellent spirits, which even supported him under large advances of\nmoney; for his powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been\ntested by anything more difficult than a chairman’s speech introducing\nother orators, or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter, from which he\ncame away with a sense that he was a tactician by nature, and that it\nwas a pity he had not gone earlier into this kind of thing. He was a\nlittle conscious of defeat, however, with Mr. Mawmsey, a chief\nrepresentative in Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail\ntrader, and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the\nborough—willing for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas and\nsugars to reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree impartially\nwith both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this necessity of\nelecting members was a great burthen to a town; for even if there were\nno danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand, there would\nbe the painful necessity at last of disappointing respectable people\nwhose names were on his books. He was accustomed to receive large\norders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were many of\nPinkerton’s committee whose opinions had a great weight of grocery on\ntheir side. Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke, as not too “clever in\nhis intellects,” was the more likely to forgive a grocer who gave a\nhostile vote under pressure, had become confidential in his back\nparlor.“As to Reform, sir, put it in a family light,” he said, rattling the\nsmall silver in his pocket, and smiling affably. “Will it support Mrs.\nMawmsey, and enable her to bring up six children when I am no more? I\nput the question _fictiously_, knowing what must be the answer. Very\nwell, sir. I ask you what, as a husband and a father, I am to do when\ngentlemen come to me and say, ‘Do as you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote\nagainst us, I shall get my groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor\nI like to feel that I am benefiting the country by maintaining\ntradesmen of the right color.’ Those very words have been spoken to me,\nsir, in the very chair where you are now sitting. I don’t mean by your\nhonorable self, Mr. Brooke.”“No, no, no—that’s narrow, you know. Until my butler complains to me of\nyour goods, Mr. Mawmsey,” said Mr. Brooke, soothingly, “until I hear\nthat you send bad sugars, spices—that sort of thing—I shall never order\nhim to go elsewhere.”“Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,” said Mr. Mawmsey,\nfeeling that politics were clearing up a little. “There would be some\npleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that honorable\nmanner.”“Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing to put\nyourself on our side. This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by—a\nthoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come\nfirst before the rest can follow. I quite agree with you that you’ve\ngot to look at the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now.\nWe’re all one family, you know—it’s all one cupboard. Such a thing as a\nvote, now: why, it may help to make men’s fortunes at the Cape—there’s\nno knowing what may be the effect of a vote,” Mr. Brooke ended, with a\nsense of being a little out at sea, though finding it still enjoyable.\nBut Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check."

  "content": "“I beg your pardon, sir, but I can’t afford that. When I give a vote I\nmust know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the effects on\nmy till and ledger, speaking respectfully. Prices, I’ll admit, are what\nnobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls after you’ve bought\nin currants, which are a goods that will not keep—I’ve never; myself\nseen into the ins and outs there; which is a rebuke to human pride. But\nas to one family, there’s debtor and creditor, I hope; they’re not\ngoing to reform that away; else I should vote for things staying as\nthey are. Few men have less need to cry for change than I have,\npersonally speaking—that is, for self and family. I am not one of those\nwho have nothing to lose: I mean as to respectability both in parish\nand private business, and noways in respect of your honorable self and\ncustom, which you was good enough to say you would not withdraw from\nme, vote or no vote, while the article sent in was satisfactory.”After this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his wife\nthat he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and that he\ndidn’t mind so much now about going to the poll.Mr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his tactics to\nLadislaw, who for his part was glad enough to persuade himself that he\nhad no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative\nsort, and that he worked no meaner engine than knowledge. Mr. Brooke,\nnecessarily, had his agents, who understood the nature of the\nMiddlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his ignorance on the side\nof the Bill—which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it\non the side against the Bill. Will stopped his ears. Occasionally\nParliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel,\ncould hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes.\nThere were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty\nbusiness; and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr.\nBrooke through would be quite innocent.But whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to the\nmajority on the right side was very doubtful to him. He had written out\nvarious speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had begun to\nperceive that Mr. Brooke’s mind, if it had the burthen of remembering\nany train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and\nnot easily come back again. To collect documents is one mode of serving\nyour country, and to remember the contents of a document is another.\nNo! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into thinking of\nthe right arguments at the right time was to be well plied with them\ntill they took up all the room in his brain. But here there was the\ndifficulty of finding room, so many things having been taken in\nbeforehand. Mr. Brooke himself observed that his ideas stood rather in\nhis way when he was speaking."

  "content": "However, Ladislaw’s coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for\nbefore the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the\nworthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart,\nwhich looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place,\ncommanding a large area in front and two converging streets. It was a\nfine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some\nprospect of an understanding between Bagster’s committee and Brooke’s,\nto which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such\nmanufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which\nalmost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for\nPinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr. Brooke, conscious of having weakened\nthe blasts of the “Trumpet” against him, by his reforms as a landlord\nin the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove\ninto the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored\nwaistcoat. But with regard to critical occasions, it often happens that\nall moments seem comfortably remote until the last.“This looks well, eh?” said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered. “I shall\nhave a good audience, at any rate. I like this, now—this kind of public\nmade up of one’s own neighbors, you know.”The weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had never\nthought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more attached to him\nthan if he had been sent in a box from London. But they listened\nwithout much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate,\none of them—a political personage from Brassing, who came to tell\nMiddlemarch its duty—spoke so fully, that it was alarming to think what\nthe candidate could find to say after him. Meanwhile the crowd became\ndenser, and as the political personage neared the end of his speech,\nMr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he still\nhandled his eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and exchanged\nremarks with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of summons was\nindifferent.“I’ll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,” he said, with an easy\nair, to Will, who was close behind him, and presently handed him the\nsupposed fortifier. It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an abstemious\nman, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval\nfrom the first was a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his\nenergies instead of collecting them. Pray pity him: so many English\ngentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on entirely private\ngrounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his country by standing for\nParliament—which, indeed, may also be done on private grounds, but\nbeing once undertaken does absolutely demand some speechifying."

  "content": "It was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was at all\nanxious; this, he felt sure, would be all right; he should have it\nquite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope. Embarking\nwould be easy, but the vision of open sea that might come after was\nalarming. “And questions, now,” hinted the demon just waking up in his\nstomach, “somebody may put questions about the schedules.—Ladislaw,” he\ncontinued, aloud, “just hand me the memorandum of the schedules.”When Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers were quite\nloud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans, brayings, and other\nexpressions of adverse theory, which were so moderate that Mr. Standish\n(decidedly an old bird) observed in the ear next to him, “This looks\ndangerous, by God! Hawley has got some deeper plan than this.” Still,\nthe cheers were exhilarating, and no candidate could look more amiable\nthan Mr. Brooke, with the memorandum in his breast-pocket, his left\nhand on the rail of the balcony, and his right trifling with his\neye-glass. The striking points in his appearance were his buff\nwaistcoat, short-clipped blond hair, and neutral physiognomy. He began\nwith some confidence.“Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!”This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed\nnatural.“I’m uncommonly glad to be here—I was never so proud and happy in my\nlife—never so happy, you know.”This was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right thing; for,\nunhappily, the pat opening had slipped away—even couplets from Pope may\nbe but “fallings from us, vanishings,” when fear clutches us, and a\nglass of sherry is hurrying like smoke among our ideas. Ladislaw, who\nstood at the window behind the speaker, thought, “it’s all up now. The\nonly chance is that, since the best thing won’t always do, floundering\nmay answer for once.” Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews,\nfell back on himself and his qualifications—always an appropriate\ngraceful subject for a candidate."

It\nwon’t do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on—trade,\nmanufactures, commerce, interchange of staples—that kind of thing—since\nAdam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the\nglobe:—‘Observation with extensive view,’ must look everywhere, ‘from\nChina to Peru,’ as somebody says—Johnson, I think, ‘The Rambler,’ you\nknow. That is what I have done up to a certain point—not as far as\nPeru; but I’ve not always stayed at home—I saw it wouldn’t do. I’ve\nbeen in the Levant, where some of your Middlemarch goods go—and then,\nagain, in the Baltic. The Baltic, now.”Plying among his recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might have got\nalong, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest\nseas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the\nenemy. At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders\nof the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him,\nthe effigy of himself: buff-colored waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral\nphysiognomy, painted on rag; and there had arisen, apparently in the\nair, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of\nhis words. Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at the\nopposite angles of the converging streets; but they were either blank,\nor filled by laughing listeners. The most innocent echo has an impish\nmockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and this\necho was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the precision\nof a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook. By\nthe time it said, “The Baltic, now,” the laugh which had been running\nthrough the audience became a general shout, and but for the sobering\neffects of party and that great public cause which the entanglement of\nthings had identified with “Brooke of Tipton,” the laugh might have\ncaught his committee. Mr. Bulstrode asked, reprehensively, what the new\npolice was doing; but a voice could not well be collared, and an attack\non the effigy of the candidate would have been too equivocal, since\nHawley probably meant it to be pelted."

Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than\nanxiety about what we have got to say. Mr. Brooke heard the laughter;\nbut he had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance, and he was at\nthis moment additionally excited by the tickling, stinging sense that\nhis lost exordium was coming back to fetch him from the Baltic.“That reminds me,” he went on, thrusting a hand into his side-pocket,\nwith an easy air, “if I wanted a precedent, you know—but we never want\na precedent for the right thing—but there is Chatham, now; I can’t say\nI should have supported Chatham, or Pitt, the younger Pitt—he was not a\nman of ideas, and we want ideas, you know.”“Blast your ideas! we want the Bill,” said a loud rough voice from the\ncrowd below.Immediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke,\nrepeated, “Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.” The laugh was louder\nthan ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent,\nheard distinctly the mocking echo. But it seemed to ridicule his\ninterrupter, and in that light was encouraging; so he replied with\namenity—“There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do we\nmeet for but to speak our minds—freedom of opinion, freedom of the\npress, liberty—that kind of thing? The Bill, now—you shall have the\nBill”—here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his eye-glass and take\nthe paper from his breast-pocket, with a sense of being practical and\ncoming to particulars. The invisible Punch followed:—“You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering contest, and a\nseat outside Parliament as delivered, five thousand pounds, seven\nshillings, and fourpence.”Mr. Brooke, amid the roars of laughter, turned red, let his eye-glass\nfall, and looking about him confusedly, saw the image of himself, which\nhad come nearer. The next moment he saw it dolorously bespattered with\neggs. His spirit rose a little, and his voice too."

There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd;\nwhistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater hubbub\nbecause there was shouting and struggling to put them down. No voice\nwould have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and Mr. Brooke,\ndisagreeably anointed, stood his ground no longer. The frustration\nwould have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and\nboyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter “can aver\nthat it endangered the learned gentleman’s ribs,” or can respectfully\nbear witness to “the soles of that gentleman’s boots having been\nvisible above the railing,” has perhaps more consolations attached to\nit.Mr. Brooke re-entered the committee-room, saying, as carelessly as he\ncould, “This is a little too bad, you know. I should have got the ear\nof the people by-and-by—but they didn’t give me time. I should have\ngone into the Bill by-and-by, you know,” he added, glancing at\nLadislaw. “However, things will come all right at the nomination.”But it was not resolved unanimously that things would come right; on\nthe contrary, the committee looked rather grim, and the political\npersonage from Brassing was writing busily, as if he were brewing new\ndevices.“It was Bowyer who did it,” said Mr. Standish, evasively. “I know it as\nwell as if he had been advertised. He’s uncommonly good at\nventriloquism, and he did it uncommonly well, by God! Hawley has been\nhaving him to dinner lately: there’s a fund of talent in Bowyer.”“Well, you know, you never mentioned him to me, Standish, else I would\nhave invited him to dine,” said poor Mr. Brooke, who had gone through a\ngreat deal of inviting for the good of his country.“There’s not a more paltry fellow in Middlemarch than Bowyer,” said\nLadislaw, indignantly, “but it seems as if the paltry fellows were\nalways to turn the scale.”"

If the impassable gulf between himself and Dorothea\nwere ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his going away and\ngetting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here and\nslipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke’s. Then\ncame the young dream of wonders that he might do—in five years, for\nexample: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher\nvalue now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they\nmight give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking\nDorothea to step down to him. Five years:—if he could only be sure that\nshe cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware\nthat he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering\nhimself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at\nfive-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things,\nwhere talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.\nHe could speak and he could write; he could master any subject if he\nchose, and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on\nwhich he would carry all his ardor. Why should he not one day be lifted\nabove the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that\neminence well? Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch, go to town,\nand make himself fit for celebrity by “eating his dinners.”But not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him\nand Dorothea. He could not be satisfied until she knew why, even if he\nwere the man she would choose to marry, he would not marry her. Hence\nhe must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer.But he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him\nin the wish to break up their connection. Deputations without and\nvoices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a\nstronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to\nwithdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he left the advantages\nof his canvassing machinery. He himself called this a strong measure,\nbut observed that his health was less capable of sustaining excitement\nthan he had imagined.“I have felt uneasy about the chest—it won’t do to carry that too far,”\nhe said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair. “I must pull up. Poor\nCasaubon was a warning, you know. I’ve made some heavy advances, but\nI’ve dug a channel. It’s rather coarse work—this electioneering, eh,\nLadislaw? dare say you are tired of it. However, we have dug a channel\nwith the ‘Pioneer’—put things in a track, and so on. A more ordinary\nman than you might carry it on now—more ordinary, you know.”“Do you wish me to give it up?” said Will, the quick color coming in\nhis face, as he rose from the writing-table, and took a turn of three\nsteps with his hands in his pockets. “I am ready to do so whenever you\nwish it.”"

But about the ‘Pioneer,’ I have been consulting a\nlittle with some of the men on our side, and they are inclined to take\nit into their hands—indemnify me to a certain extent—carry it on, in\nfact. And under the circumstances, you might like to give up—might find\na better field. These people might not take that high view of you which\nI have always taken, as an alter ego, a right hand—though I always\nlooked forward to your doing something else. I think of having a run\ninto France. But I’ll write you any letters, you know—to Althorpe and\npeople of that kind. I’ve met Althorpe.”“I am exceedingly obliged to you,” said Ladislaw, proudly. “Since you\nare going to part with the ‘Pioneer,’ I need not trouble you about the\nsteps I shall take. I may choose to continue here for the present.”After Mr. Brooke had left him Will said to himself, “The rest of the\nfamily have been urging him to get rid of me, and he doesn’t care now\nabout my going. I shall stay as long as I like. I shall go of my own\nmovements and not because they are afraid of me.”CHAPTER LII.“His heart\nThe lowliest duties on itself did lay.”\n—WORDSWORTH.On that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that he was to have the\nLowick living, there was joy in the old fashioned parlor, and even the\nportraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction. His\nmother left her tea and toast untouched, but sat with her usual pretty\nprimness, only showing her emotion by that flush in the cheeks and\nbrightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary\nidentity with her far-off youthful self, and saying decisively—“The greatest comfort, Camden, is that you have deserved it.”“When a man gets a good berth, mother, half the deserving must come\nafter,” said the son, brimful of pleasure, and not trying to conceal\nit. The gladness in his face was of that active kind which seems to\nhave energy enough not only to flash outwardly, but to light up busy\nvision within: one seemed to see thoughts, as well as delight, in his\nglances.“Now, aunt,” he went on, rubbing his hands and looking at Miss Noble,\nwho was making tender little beaver-like noises, “There shall be\nsugar-candy always on the table for you to steal and give to the\nchildren, and you shall have a great many new stockings to make\npresents of, and you shall darn your own more than ever!”Miss Noble nodded at her nephew with a subdued half-frightened laugh,\nconscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into\nher basket on the strength of the new preferment."

But who is in love with me? I am a seedy old\nfellow,” said the Vicar, rising, pushing his chair away and looking\ndown at himself. “What do you say, mother?”“You are a handsome man, Camden: though not so fine a figure of a man\nas your father,” said the old lady.“I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother,” said Miss Winifred. “She\nwould make us so lively at Lowick.”“Very fine! You talk as if young women were tied up to be chosen, like\npoultry at market; as if I had only to ask and everybody would have\nme,” said the Vicar, not caring to specify.“We don’t want everybody,” said Miss Winifred. “But _you_ would like\nMiss Garth, mother, shouldn’t you?”“My son’s choice shall be mine,” said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic\ndiscretion, “and a wife would be most welcome, Camden. You will want\nyour whist at home when we go to Lowick, and Henrietta Noble never was\na whist-player.” (Mrs. Farebrother always called her tiny old sister by\nthat magnificent name.)“I shall do without whist now, mother.”“Why so, Camden? In my time whist was thought an undeniable amusement\nfor a good churchman,” said Mrs. Farebrother, innocent of the meaning\nthat whist had for her son, and speaking rather sharply, as at some\ndangerous countenancing of new doctrine.“I shall be too busy for whist; I shall have two parishes,” said the\nVicar, preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game.He had already said to Dorothea, “I don’t feel bound to give up St.\nBotolph’s. It is protest enough against the pluralism they want to\nreform if I give somebody else most of the money. The stronger thing is\nnot to give up power, but to use it well.”"

It seems very unfitting that I should have this patronage, yet I\nfelt that I ought not to let it be used by some one else instead of\nme.”“It is I who am bound to act so that you will not regret your power,”\nsaid Mr. Farebrother.His was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active\nwhen the yoke of life ceases to gall them. He made no display of\nhumility on the subject, but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that\nhis conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices\nwere free from.“I used often to wish I had been something else than a clergyman,” he\nsaid to Lydgate, “but perhaps it will be better to try and make as good\na clergyman out of myself as I can. That is the well-beneficed point of\nview, you perceive, from which difficulties are much simplified,” he\nended, smiling.The Vicar did feel then as if his share of duties would be easy. But\nDuty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly—something like a heavy friend\nwhom we have amiably asked to visit us, and who breaks his leg within\nour gates.Hardly a week later, Duty presented itself in his study under the\ndisguise of Fred Vincy, now returned from Omnibus College with his\nbachelor’s degree.“I am ashamed to trouble you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred, whose fair\nopen face was propitiating, “but you are the only friend I can consult.\nI told you everything once before, and you were so good that I can’t\nhelp coming to you again.”“Sit down, Fred, I’m ready to hear and do anything I can,” said the\nVicar, who was busy packing some small objects for removal, and went on\nwith his work.“I wanted to tell you—” Fred hesitated an instant and then went on\nplungingly, “I might go into the Church now; and really, look where I\nmay, I can’t see anything else to do. I don’t like it, but I know it’s\nuncommonly hard on my father to say so, after he has spent a good deal\nof money in educating me for it.” Fred paused again an instant, and\nthen repeated, “and I can’t see anything else to do.”"

But you have got over one bridge now:\nwhat are your other difficulties?”“Merely that I don’t like it. I don’t like divinity, and preaching, and\nfeeling obliged to look serious. I like riding across country, and\ndoing as other men do. I don’t mean that I want to be a bad fellow in\nany way; but I’ve no taste for the sort of thing people expect of a\nclergyman. And yet what else am I to do? My father can’t spare me any\ncapital, else I might go into farming. And he has no room for me in his\ntrade. And of course I can’t begin to study for law or physic now, when\nmy father wants me to earn something. It’s all very well to say I’m\nwrong to go into the Church; but those who say so might as well tell me\nto go into the backwoods.”Fred’s voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance, and Mr.\nFarebrother might have been inclined to smile if his mind had not been\ntoo busy in imagining more than Fred told him.“Have you any difficulties about doctrines—about the Articles?” he\nsaid, trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred’s sake.“No; I suppose the Articles are right. I am not prepared with any\narguments to disprove them, and much better, cleverer fellows than I am\ngo in for them entirely. I think it would be rather ridiculous in me to\nurge scruples of that sort, as if I were a judge,” said Fred, quite\nsimply.“I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair\nparish priest without being much of a divine?”“Of course, if I am obliged to be a clergyman, I shall try and do my\nduty, though I mayn’t like it. Do you think any body ought to blame\nme?”“For going into the Church under the circumstances? That depends on\nyour conscience, Fred—how far you have counted the cost, and seen what\nyour position will require of you. I can only tell you about myself,\nthat I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence.”"

There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her ever since we\nwere children.”“Miss Garth, I suppose?” said the Vicar, examining some labels very\nclosely.“Yes. I shouldn’t mind anything if she would have me. And I know I\ncould be a good fellow then.”“And you think she returns the feeling?”“She never will say so; and a good while ago she made me promise not to\nspeak to her about it again. And she has set her mind especially\nagainst my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can’t give her up. I\ndo think she cares about me. I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she said\nthat Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother.”“Yes, she is very kindly helping my sister. Do you wish to go there?”“No, I want to ask a great favor of you. I am ashamed to bother you in\nthis way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you mentioned the\nsubject to her—I mean about my going into the Church.”“That is rather a delicate task, my dear Fred. I shall have to\npresuppose your attachment to her; and to enter on the subject as you\nwish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether she returns it.”“That is what I want her to tell you,” said Fred, bluntly. “I don’t\nknow what to do, unless I can get at her feeling.”“You mean that you would be guided by that as to your going into the\nChurch?”“If Mary said she would never have me I might as well go wrong in one\nway as another.”“That is nonsense, Fred. Men outlive their love, but they don’t outlive\nthe consequences of their recklessness.”“Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary. If I had\nto give her up, it would be like beginning to live on wooden legs.”“Will she not be hurt at my intrusion?”"

There is no one else who could be such a friend to both of us.”\nFred paused a moment, and then said, rather complainingly, “And she\nought to acknowledge that I have worked in order to pass. She ought to\nbelieve that I would exert myself for her sake.”There was a moment’s silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down his work,\nand putting out his hand to Fred said—“Very well, my boy. I will do what you wish.”That very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which\nhe had just set up. “Decidedly I am an old stalk,” he thought, “the\nyoung growths are pushing me aside.”He found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals\non a sheet. The sun was low, and tall trees sent their shadows across\nthe grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol. She\ndid not observe Mr. Farebrother’s approach along the grass, and had\njust stooped down to lecture a small black-and-tan terrier, which would\npersist in walking on the sheet and smelling at the rose-leaves as Mary\nsprinkled them. She took his fore-paws in one hand, and lifted up the\nforefinger of the other, while the dog wrinkled his brows and looked\nembarrassed. “Fly, Fly, I am ashamed of you,” Mary was saying in a\ngrave contralto. “This is not becoming in a sensible dog; anybody would\nthink you were a silly young gentleman.”“You are unmerciful to young gentlemen, Miss Garth,” said the Vicar,\nwithin two yards of her.Mary started up and blushed. “It always answers to reason with Fly,”\nshe said, laughingly.“But not with young gentlemen?”“Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men.”“I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to\ninterest you in a young gentleman.”“Not a silly one, I hope,” said Mary, beginning to pluck the roses\nagain, and feeling her heart beat uncomfortably.“No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather\naffection and sincerity. However, wisdom lies more in those two\nqualities than people are apt to imagine. I hope you know by those\nmarks what young gentleman I mean.”“Yes, I think I do,” said Mary, bravely, her face getting more serious,\nand her hands cold; “it must be Fred Vincy.”"
