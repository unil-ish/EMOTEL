  "content": "“Pray sit down,” said Dorothea, crossing her hands on her lap; “I am\nvery glad you were here.” Will thought that her face looked just as it\ndid when she first shook hands with him in Rome; for her widow’s cap,\nfixed in her bonnet, had gone off with it, and he could see that she\nhad lately been shedding tears. But the mixture of anger in her\nagitation had vanished at the sight of him; she had been used, when\nthey were face to face, always to feel confidence and the happy freedom\nwhich comes with mutual understanding, and how could other people’s\nwords hinder that effect on a sudden? Let the music which can take\npossession of our frame and fill the air with joy for us, sound once\nmore—what does it signify that we heard it found fault with in its\nabsence?“I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to see you,”\nsaid Will, seating himself opposite to her. “I am going away\nimmediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again.”“I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago—you\nthought you were going then,” said Dorothea, her voice trembling a\nlittle.“Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now—things\nwhich have altered my feelings about the future. When I saw you before,\nI was dreaming that I might come back some day. I don’t think I ever\nshall—now.” Will paused here.“You wished me to know the reasons?” said Dorothea, timidly.“Yes,” said Will, impetuously, shaking his head backward, and looking\naway from her with irritation in his face. “Of course I must wish it. I\nhave been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others.\nThere has been a mean implication against my character. I wish you to\nknow that under no circumstances would I have lowered myself by—under\nno circumstances would I have given men the chance of saying that I\nsought money under the pretext of seeking—something else. There was no\nneed of other safeguard against me—the safeguard of wealth was enough.”Will rose from his chair with the last word and went—he hardly knew\nwhere; but it was to the projecting window nearest him, which had been\nopen as now about the same season a year ago, when he and Dorothea had\nstood within it and talked together. Her whole heart was going out at\nthis moment in sympathy with Will’s indignation: she only wanted to\nconvince him that she had never done him injustice, and he seemed to\nhave turned away from her as if she too had been part of the unfriendly\nworld.“It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any\nmeanness to you,” she began. Then in her ardent way, wanting to plead\nwith him, she moved from her chair and went in front of him to her old\nplace in the window, saying, “Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in\nyou?”"

  "content": "When Will saw her there, he gave a start and moved backward out of the\nwindow, without meeting her glance. Dorothea was hurt by this movement\nfollowing up the previous anger of his tone. She was ready to say that\nit was as hard on her as on him, and that she was helpless; but those\nstrange particulars of their relation which neither of them could\nexplicitly mention kept her always in dread of saying too much. At this\nmoment she had no belief that Will would in any case have wanted to\nmarry her, and she feared using words which might imply such a belief.\nShe only said earnestly, recurring to his last word—“I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against you.”Will did not answer. In the stormy fluctuation of his feelings these\nwords of hers seemed to him cruelly neutral, and he looked pale and\nmiserable after his angry outburst. He went to the table and fastened\nup his portfolio, while Dorothea looked at him from the distance. They\nwere wasting these last moments together in wretched silence. What\ncould he say, since what had got obstinately uppermost in his mind was\nthe passionate love for her which he forbade himself to utter? What\ncould she say, since she might offer him no help—since she was forced\nto keep the money that ought to have been his?—since to-day he seemed\nnot to respond as he used to do to her thorough trust and liking?But Will at last turned away from his portfolio and approached the\nwindow again.“I must go,” he said, with that peculiar look of the eyes which\nsometimes accompanies bitter feeling, as if they had been tired and\nburned with gazing too close at a light.“What shall you do in life?” said Dorothea, timidly. “Have your\nintentions remained just the same as when we said good-by before?”“Yes,” said Will, in a tone that seemed to waive the subject as\nuninteresting. “I shall work away at the first thing that offers. I\nsuppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope.”“Oh, what sad words!” said Dorothea, with a dangerous tendency to sob.\nThen trying to smile, she added, “We used to agree that we were alike\nin speaking too strongly.”"

  "content": "“I have not spoken too strongly now,” said Will, leaning back against\nthe angle of the wall. “There are certain things which a man can only\ngo through once in his life; and he must know some time or other that\nthe best is over with him. This experience has happened to me while I\nam very young—that is all. What I care more for than I can ever care\nfor anything else is absolutely forbidden to me—I don’t mean merely by\nbeing out of my reach, but forbidden me, even if it were within my\nreach, by my own pride and honor—by everything I respect myself for. Of\ncourse I shall go on living as a man might do who had seen heaven in a\ntrance.”Will paused, imagining that it would be impossible for Dorothea to\nmisunderstand this; indeed he felt that he was contradicting himself\nand offending against his self-approval in speaking to her so plainly;\nbut still—it could not be fairly called wooing a woman to tell her that\nhe would never woo her. It must be admitted to be a ghostly kind of\nwooing.But Dorothea’s mind was rapidly going over the past with quite another\nvision than his. The thought that she herself might be what Will most\ncared for did throb through her an instant, but then came doubt: the\nmemory of the little they had lived through together turned pale and\nshrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have\nbeen the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom he had\nhad constant companionship. Everything he had said might refer to that\nother relation, and whatever had passed between him and herself was\nthoroughly explained by what she had always regarded as their simple\nfriendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by her husband’s\ninjurious act. Dorothea stood silent, with her eyes cast down dreamily,\nwhile images crowded upon her which left the sickening certainty that\nWill was referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening? He wanted her to\nknow that here too his conduct should be above suspicion.Will was not surprised at her silence. His mind also was tumultuously\nbusy while he watched her, and he was feeling rather wildly that\nsomething must happen to hinder their parting—some miracle, clearly\nnothing in their own deliberate speech. Yet, after all, had she any\nlove for him?—he could not pretend to himself that he would rather\nbelieve her to be without that pain. He could not deny that a secret\nlonging for the assurance that she loved him was at the root of all his\nwords.Neither of them knew how long they stood in that way. Dorothea was\nraising her eyes, and was about to speak, when the door opened and her\nfootman came to say—"

Then turning to Will, she said, “I have\nsome memoranda to write for the housekeeper.”“I must go,” said Will, when the door had closed again—advancing\ntowards her. “The day after to-morrow I shall leave Middlemarch.”“You have acted in every way rightly,” said Dorothea, in a low tone,\nfeeling a pressure at her heart which made it difficult to speak.She put out her hand, and Will took it for an instant without speaking,\nfor her words had seemed to him cruelly cold and unlike herself. Their\neyes met, but there was discontent in his, and in hers there was only\nsadness. He turned away and took his portfolio under his arm.“I have never done you injustice. Please remember me,” said Dorothea,\nrepressing a rising sob.“Why should you say that?” said Will, with irritation. “As if I were\nnot in danger of forgetting everything else.”"

  "content": "He had really a movement of anger against her at that moment, and it\nimpelled him to go away without pause. It was all one flash to\nDorothea—his last words—his distant bow to her as he reached the\ndoor—the sense that he was no longer there. She sank into the chair,\nand for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and emotions were\nhurrying upon her. Joy came first, in spite of the threatening train\nbehind it—joy in the impression that it was really herself whom Will\nloved and was renouncing, that there was really no other love less\npermissible, more blameworthy, which honor was hurrying him away from.\nThey were parted all the same, but—Dorothea drew a deep breath and felt\nher strength return—she could think of him unrestrainedly. At that\nmoment the parting was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and\nbeing loved excluded sorrow. It was as if some hard icy pressure had\nmelted, and her consciousness had room to expand: her past was come\nback to her with larger interpretation. The joy was not the\nless—perhaps it was the more complete just then—because of the\nirrevocable parting; for there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder\nto imagine in any eye or from any lips. He had acted so as to defy\nreproach, and make wonder respectful.Any one watching her might have seen that there was a fortifying\nthought within her. Just as when inventive power is working with glad\nease some small claim on the attention is fully met as if it were only\na cranny opened to the sunlight, it was easy now for Dorothea to write\nher memoranda. She spoke her last words to the housekeeper in cheerful\ntones, and when she seated herself in the carriage her eyes were bright\nand her cheeks blooming under the dismal bonnet. She threw back the\nheavy “weepers,” and looked before her, wondering which road Will had\ntaken. It was in her nature to be proud that he was blameless, and\nthrough all her feelings there ran this vein—“I was right to defend\nhim.”The coachman was used to drive his grays at a good pace, Mr. Casaubon\nbeing unenjoying and impatient in everything away from his desk, and\nwanting to get to the end of all journeys; and Dorothea was now bowled\nalong quickly. Driving was pleasant, for rain in the night had laid the\ndust, and the blue sky looked far off, away from the region of the\ngreat clouds that sailed in masses. The earth looked like a happy place\nunder the vast heavens, and Dorothea was wishing that she might\novertake Will and see him once more.After a turn of the road, there he was with the portfolio under his\narm; but the next moment she was passing him while he raised his hat,\nand she felt a pang at being seated there in a sort of exaltation,\nleaving him behind. She could not look back at him. It was as if a\ncrowd of indifferent objects had thrust them asunder, and forced them\nalong different paths, taking them farther and farther away from each\nother, and making it useless to look back. She could no more make any\nsign that would seem to say, “Need we part?” than she could stop the\ncarriage to wait for him. Nay, what a world of reasons crowded upon her\nagainst any movement of her thought towards a future that might reverse\nthe decision of this day!"

And if I\ncould but have given him the money, and made things easier for\nhim!”—were the longings that came back the most persistently. And yet,\nso heavily did the world weigh on her in spite of her independent\nenergy, that with this idea of Will as in need of such help and at a\ndisadvantage with the world, there came always the vision of that\nunfittingness of any closer relation between them which lay in the\nopinion of every one connected with her. She felt to the full all the\nimperativeness of the motives which urged Will’s conduct. How could he\ndream of her defying the barrier that her husband had placed between\nthem?—how could she ever say to herself that she would defy it?Will’s certainty as the carriage grew smaller in the distance, had much\nmore bitterness in it. Very slight matters were enough to gall him in\nhis sensitive mood, and the sight of Dorothea driving past him while he\nfelt himself plodding along as a poor devil seeking a position in a\nworld which in his present temper offered him little that he coveted,\nmade his conduct seem a mere matter of necessity, and took away the\nsustainment of resolve. After all, he had no assurance that she loved\nhim: could any man pretend that he was simply glad in such a case to\nhave the suffering all on his own side?That evening Will spent with the Lydgates; the next evening he was\ngone.BOOK VII.\nTWO TEMPTATIONS.CHAPTER LXIII.These little things are great to little man.—GOLDSMITH.“Have you seen much of your scientific phoenix, Lydgate, lately?” said\nMr. Toller at one of his Christmas dinner-parties, speaking to Mr.\nFarebrother on his right hand.“Not much, I am sorry to say,” answered the Vicar, accustomed to parry\nMr. Toller’s banter about his belief in the new medical light. “I am\nout of the way and he is too busy.”“Is he? I am glad to hear it,” said Dr. Minchin, with mingled suavity\nand surprise.“He gives a great deal of time to the New Hospital,” said Mr.\nFarebrother, who had his reasons for continuing the subject: “I hear of\nthat from my neighbor, Mrs. Casaubon, who goes there often. She says\nLydgate is indefatigable, and is making a fine thing of Bulstrode’s\ninstitution. He is preparing a new ward in case of the cholera coming\nto us.”“And preparing theories of treatment to try on the patients, I\nsuppose,” said Mr. Toller.“Come, Toller, be candid,” said Mr. Farebrother. “You are too clever\nnot to see the good of a bold fresh mind in medicine, as well as in\neverything else; and as to cholera, I fancy, none of you are very sure\nwhat you ought to do. If a man goes a little too far along a new road,\nit is usually himself that he harms more than any one else.”"

  "content": "“I am sure you and Wrench ought to be obliged to him,” said Dr.\nMinchin, looking towards Toller, “for he has sent you the cream of\nPeacock’s patients.”“Lydgate has been living at a great rate for a young beginner,” said\nMr. Harry Toller, the brewer. “I suppose his relations in the North\nback him up.”“I hope so,” said Mr. Chichely, “else he ought not to have married that\nnice girl we were all so fond of. Hang it, one has a grudge against a\nman who carries off the prettiest girl in the town.”“Ay, by God! and the best too,” said Mr. Standish.“My friend Vincy didn’t half like the marriage, I know that,” said Mr.\nChichely. “_He_ wouldn’t do much. How the relations on the other side\nmay have come down I can’t say.” There was an emphatic kind of\nreticence in Mr. Chichely’s manner of speaking.“Oh, I shouldn’t think Lydgate ever looked to practice for a living,”\nsaid Mr. Toller, with a slight touch of sarcasm, and there the subject\nwas dropped."

  "content": "This was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of\nLydgate’s expenses being obviously too great to be met by his practice,\nbut he thought it not unlikely that there were resources or\nexpectations which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate’s\nmarriage, and which might hinder any bad consequences from the\ndisappointment in his practice. One evening, when he took the pains to\ngo to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old, he\nnoticed in him an air of excited effort quite unlike his usual easy way\nof keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever he had\nanything to say. Lydgate talked persistently when they were in his\nwork-room, putting arguments for and against the probability of certain\nbiological views; but he had none of those definite things to say or to\nshow which give the waymarks of a patient uninterrupted pursuit, such\nas he used himself to insist on, saying that “there must be a systole\nand diastole in all inquiry,” and that “a man’s mind must be\ncontinually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and\nthe horizon of an object-glass.” That evening he seemed to be talking\nwidely for the sake of resisting any personal bearing; and before long\nthey went into the drawing room, where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond\nto give them music, sank back in his chair in silence, but with a\nstrange light in his eyes. “He may have been taking an opiate,” was a\nthought that crossed Mr. Farebrother’s mind—“tic-douloureux perhaps—or\nmedical worries.”It did not occur to him that Lydgate’s marriage was not delightful: he\nbelieved, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile\ncreature, though he had always thought her rather uninteresting—a\nlittle too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and his\nmother could not forgive Rosamond because she never seemed to see that\nHenrietta Noble was in the room. “However, Lydgate fell in love with\nher,” said the Vicar to himself, “and she must be to his taste.”Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very\nlittle corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care\nabout personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or\nfoolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate\nshrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his\nprivate affairs. And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller’s, the\nVicar learned something which made him watch the more eagerly for an\nopportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he wanted to\nopen himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready."

  "content": "The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy’s, where, on New Year’s Day, there\nwas a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the\nplea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first new year of\nhis being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar. And this party\nwas thoroughly friendly: all the ladies of the Farebrother family were\npresent; the Vincy children all dined at the table, and Fred had\npersuaded his mother that if she did not invite Mary Garth, the\nFarebrothers would regard it as a slight to themselves, Mary being\ntheir particular friend. Mary came, and Fred was in high spirits,\nthough his enjoyment was of a checkered kind—triumph that his mother\nshould see Mary’s importance with the chief personages in the party\nbeing much streaked with jealousy when Mr. Farebrother sat down by her.\nFred used to be much more easy about his own accomplishments in the\ndays when he had not begun to dread being “bowled out by Farebrother,”\nand this terror was still before him. Mrs. Vincy, in her fullest\nmatronly bloom, looked at Mary’s little figure, rough wavy hair, and\nvisage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying\nunsuccessfully to fancy herself caring about Mary’s appearance in\nwedding clothes, or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would\n“feature” the Garths. However, the party was a merry one, and Mary was\nparticularly bright; being glad, for Fred’s sake, that his friends were\ngetting kinder to her, and being also quite willing that they should\nsee how much she was valued by others whom they must admit to be\njudges.Mr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mr. Vincy\nspoke as little as possible to his son-in-law. Rosamond was perfectly\ngraceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had\nnot been roused to bestow on her would have perceived the total absence\nof that interest in her husband’s presence which a loving wife is sure\nto betray, even if etiquette keeps her aloof from him. When Lydgate was\ntaking part in the conversation, she never looked towards him any more\nthan if she had been a sculptured Psyche modelled to look another way:\nand when, after being called out for an hour or two, he re-entered the\nroom, she seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months before\nwould have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers. In reality,\nhowever, she was intensely aware of Lydgate’s voice and movements; and\nher pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a studied negation\nby which she satisfied her inward opposition to him without compromise\nof propriety. When the ladies were in the drawing-room after Lydgate\nhad been called away from the dessert, Mrs. Farebrother, when Rosamond\nhappened to be near her, said—“You have to give up a great deal of your\nhusband’s society, Mrs. Lydgate.”“Yes, the life of a medical man is very arduous: especially when he is\nso devoted to his profession as Mr. Lydgate is,” said Rosamond, who was\nstanding, and moved easily away at the end of this correct little\nspeech."

  "content": "“It is dreadfully dull for her when there is no company,” said Mrs.\nVincy, who was seated at the old lady’s side. “I am sure I thought so\nwhen Rosamond was ill, and I was staying with her. You know, Mrs.\nFarebrother, ours is a cheerful house. I am of a cheerful disposition\nmyself, and Mr. Vincy always likes something to be going on. That is\nwhat Rosamond has been used to. Very different from a husband out at\nodd hours, and never knowing when he will come home, and of a close,\nproud disposition, _I_ think”—indiscreet Mrs. Vincy did lower her tone\nslightly with this parenthesis. “But Rosamond always had an angel of a\ntemper; her brothers used very often not to please her, but she was\nnever the girl to show temper; from a baby she was always as good as\ngood, and with a complexion beyond anything. But my children are all\ngood-tempered, thank God.”This was easily credible to any one looking at Mrs. Vincy as she threw\nback her broad cap-strings, and smiled towards her three little girls,\naged from seven to eleven. But in that smiling glance she was obliged\nto include Mary Garth, whom the three girls had got into a corner to\nmake her tell them stories. Mary was just finishing the delicious tale\nof Rumpelstiltskin, which she had well by heart, because Letty was\nnever tired of communicating it to her ignorant elders from a favorite\nred volume. Louisa, Mrs. Vincy’s darling, now ran to her with wide-eyed\nserious excitement, crying, “Oh mamma, mamma, the little man stamped so\nhard on the floor he couldn’t get his leg out again!”“Bless you, my cherub!” said mamma; “you shall tell me all about it\nto-morrow. Go and listen!” and then, as her eyes followed Louisa back\ntowards the attractive corner, she thought that if Fred wished her to\ninvite Mary again she would make no objection, the children being so\npleased with her.But presently the corner became still more animated, for Mr.\nFarebrother came in, and seating himself behind Louisa, took her on his\nlap; whereupon the girls all insisted that he must hear\nRumpelstiltskin, and Mary must tell it over again. He insisted too, and\nMary, without fuss, began again in her neat fashion, with precisely the\nsame words as before. Fred, who had also seated himself near, would\nhave felt unmixed triumph in Mary’s effectiveness if Mr. Farebrother\nhad not been looking at her with evident admiration, while he\ndramatized an intense interest in the tale to please the children.“You will never care any more about my one-eyed giant, Loo,” said Fred\nat the end.“Yes, I shall. Tell about him now,” said Louisa.“Oh, I dare say; I am quite cut out. Ask Mr. Farebrother.”"

If I try to draw a story out of my\nbag a sermon comes instead. Shall I preach you a sermon?” said he,\nputting on his short-sighted glasses, and pursing up his lips.“Yes,” said Louisa, falteringly.“Let me see, then. Against cakes: how cakes are bad things, especially\nif they are sweet and have plums in them.”Louisa took the affair rather seriously, and got down from the Vicar’s\nknee to go to Fred.“Ah, I see it will not do to preach on New Year’s Day,” said Mr.\nFarebrother, rising and walking away. He had discovered of late that\nFred had become jealous of him, and also that he himself was not losing\nhis preference for Mary above all other women.“A delightful young person is Miss Garth,” said Mrs. Farebrother, who\nhad been watching her son’s movements.“Yes,” said Mrs. Vincy, obliged to reply, as the old lady turned to her\nexpectantly. “It is a pity she is not better-looking.”“I cannot say that,” said Mrs. Farebrother, decisively. “I like her\ncountenance. We must not always ask for beauty, when a good God has\nseen fit to make an excellent young woman without it. I put good\nmanners first, and Miss Garth will know how to conduct herself in any\nstation.”The old lady was a little sharp in her tone, having a prospective\nreference to Mary’s becoming her daughter-in-law; for there was this\ninconvenience in Mary’s position with regard to Fred, that it was not\nsuitable to be made public, and hence the three ladies at Lowick\nParsonage were still hoping that Camden would choose Miss Garth."

Mr. Farebrother played a rubber to satisfy his\nmother, who regarded her occasional whist as a protest against scandal\nand novelty of opinion, in which light even a revoke had its dignity.\nBut at the end he got Mr. Chichely to take his place, and left the\nroom. As he crossed the hall, Lydgate had just come in and was taking\noff his great-coat.“You are the man I was going to look for,” said the Vicar; and instead\nof entering the drawing-room, they walked along the hall and stood\nagainst the fireplace, where the frosty air helped to make a glowing\nbank. “You see, I can leave the whist-table easily enough,” he went on,\nsmiling at Lydgate, “now I don’t play for money. I owe that to you,\nMrs. Casaubon says.”“How?” said Lydgate, coldly.“Ah, you didn’t mean me to know it; I call that ungenerous reticence.\nYou should let a man have the pleasure of feeling that you have done\nhim a good turn. I don’t enter into some people’s dislike of being\nunder an obligation: upon my word, I prefer being under an obligation\nto everybody for behaving well to me.”“I can’t tell what you mean,” said Lydgate, “unless it is that I once\nspoke of you to Mrs. Casaubon. But I did not think that she would break\nher promise not to mention that I had done so,” said Lydgate, leaning\nhis back against the corner of the mantel-piece, and showing no\nradiance in his face.“It was Brooke who let it out, only the other day. He paid me the\ncompliment of saying that he was very glad I had the living though you\nhad come across his tactics, and had praised me up as a Ken and a\nTillotson, and that sort of thing, till Mrs. Casaubon would hear of no\none else.”“Oh, Brooke is such a leaky-minded fool,” said Lydgate, contemptuously.“Well, I was glad of the leakiness then. I don’t see why you shouldn’t\nlike me to know that you wished to do me a service, my dear fellow. And\nyou certainly have done me one. It’s rather a strong check to one’s\nself-complacency to find how much of one’s right doing depends on not\nbeing in want of money. A man will not be tempted to say the Lord’s\nPrayer backward to please the devil, if he doesn’t want the devil’s\nservices. I have no need to hang on the smiles of chance now.”“I don’t see that there’s any money-getting without chance,” said\nLydgate; “if a man gets it in a profession, it’s pretty sure to come by\nchance.”"

  "content": "Mr. Farebrother thought he could account for this speech, in striking\ncontrast with Lydgate’s former way of talking, as the perversity which\nwill often spring from the moodiness of a man ill at ease in his\naffairs. He answered in a tone of good-humored admission—“Ah, there’s enormous patience wanted with the way of the world. But it\nis the easier for a man to wait patiently when he has friends who love\nhim, and ask for nothing better than to help him through, so far as it\nlies in their power.”“Oh yes,” said Lydgate, in a careless tone, changing his attitude and\nlooking at his watch. “People make much more of their difficulties than\nthey need to do.”He knew as distinctly as possible that this was an offer of help to\nhimself from Mr. Farebrother, and he could not bear it. So strangely\ndetermined are we mortals, that, after having been long gratified with\nthe sense that he had privately done the Vicar a service, the\nsuggestion that the Vicar discerned his need of a service in return\nmade him shrink into unconquerable reticence. Besides, behind all\nmaking of such offers what else must come?—that he should “mention his\ncase,” imply that he wanted specific things. At that moment, suicide\nseemed easier.Mr. Farebrother was too keen a man not to know the meaning of that\nreply, and there was a certain massiveness in Lydgate’s manner and\ntone, corresponding with his physique, which if he repelled your\nadvances in the first instance seemed to put persuasive devices out of\nquestion.“What time are you?” said the Vicar, devouring his wounded feeling.“After eleven,” said Lydgate. And they went into the drawing-room.CHAPTER LXIV.1_st Gent_. Where lies the power, there let the blame lie too.2_d Gent_. Nay, power is relative; you cannot fright\n    The coming pest with border fortresses,\n    Or catch your carp with subtle argument.\n    All force is twain in one: cause is not cause\n    Unless effect be there; and action’s self\n    Must needs contain a passive. So command\n    Exists but with obedience."

  "content": "Even if Lydgate had been inclined to be quite open about his affairs,\nhe knew that it would have hardly been in Mr. Farebrother’s power to\ngive him the help he immediately wanted. With the year’s bills coming\nin from his tradesmen, with Dover’s threatening hold on his furniture,\nand with nothing to depend on but slow dribbling payments from patients\nwho must not be offended—for the handsome fees he had had from Freshitt\nHall and Lowick Manor had been easily absorbed—nothing less than a\nthousand pounds would have freed him from actual embarrassment, and\nleft a residue which, according to the favorite phrase of hopefulness\nin such circumstances, would have given him “time to look about him.”Naturally, the merry Christmas bringing the happy New Year, when\nfellow-citizens expect to be paid for the trouble and goods they have\nsmilingly bestowed on their neighbors, had so tightened the pressure of\nsordid cares on Lydgate’s mind that it was hardly possible for him to\nthink unbrokenly of any other subject, even the most habitual and\nsoliciting. He was not an ill-tempered man; his intellectual activity,\nthe ardent kindness of his heart, as well as his strong frame, would\nalways, under tolerably easy conditions, have kept him above the petty\nuncontrolled susceptibilities which make bad temper. But he was now a\nprey to that worst irritation which arises not simply from annoyances,\nbut from the second consciousness underlying those annoyances, of\nwasted energy and a degrading preoccupation, which was the reverse of\nall his former purposes. “_This_ is what I am thinking of; and _that_\nis what I might have been thinking of,” was the bitter incessant murmur\nwithin him, making every difficulty a double goad to impatience."

  "content": "Some gentlemen have made an amazing figure in literature by general\ndiscontent with the universe as a trap of dulness into which their\ngreat souls have fallen by mistake; but the sense of a stupendous self\nand an insignificant world may have its consolations. Lydgate’s\ndiscontent was much harder to bear: it was the sense that there was a\ngrand existence in thought and effective action lying around him, while\nhis self was being narrowed into the miserable isolation of egoistic\nfears, and vulgar anxieties for events that might allay such fears. His\ntroubles will perhaps appear miserably sordid, and beneath the\nattention of lofty persons who can know nothing of debt except on a\nmagnificent scale. Doubtless they were sordid; and for the majority,\nwho are not lofty, there is no escape from sordidness but by being free\nfrom money-craving, with all its base hopes and temptations, its\nwatching for death, its hinted requests, its horse-dealer’s desire to\nmake bad work pass for good, its seeking for function which ought to be\nanother’s, its compulsion often to long for Luck in the shape of a wide\ncalamity.It was because Lydgate writhed under the idea of getting his neck\nbeneath this vile yoke that he had fallen into a bitter moody state\nwhich was continually widening Rosamond’s alienation from him. After\nthe first disclosure about the bill of sale, he had made many efforts\nto draw her into sympathy with him about possible measures for\nnarrowing their expenses, and with the threatening approach of\nChristmas his propositions grew more and more definite. “We two can do\nwith only one servant, and live on very little,” he said, “and I shall\nmanage with one horse.” For Lydgate, as we have seen, had begun to\nreason, with a more distinct vision, about the expenses of living, and\nany share of pride he had given to appearances of that sort was meagre\ncompared with the pride which made him revolt from exposure as a\ndebtor, or from asking men to help him with their money.“Of course you can dismiss the other two servants, if you like,” said\nRosamond; “but I should have thought it would be very injurious to your\nposition for us to live in a poor way. You must expect your practice to\nbe lowered.”“My dear Rosamond, it is not a question of choice. We have begun too\nexpensively. Peacock, you know, lived in a much smaller house than\nthis. It is my fault: I ought to have known better, and I deserve a\nthrashing—if there were anybody who had a right to give it me—for\nbringing you into the necessity of living in a poorer way than you have\nbeen used to. But we married because we loved each other, I suppose.\nAnd that may help us to pull along till things get better. Come, dear,\nput down that work and come to me.”"

Rosamond obeyed him, and he took her on his\nknee, but in her secret soul she was utterly aloof from him. The poor\nthing saw only that the world was not ordered to her liking, and\nLydgate was part of that world. But he held her waist with one hand and\nlaid the other gently on both of hers; for this rather abrupt man had\nmuch tenderness in his manners towards women, seeming to have always\npresent in his imagination the weakness of their frames and the\ndelicate poise of their health both in body and mind. And he began\nagain to speak persuasively.“I find, now I look into things a little, Rosy, that it is wonderful\nwhat an amount of money slips away in our housekeeping. I suppose the\nservants are careless, and we have had a great many people coming. But\nthere must be many in our rank who manage with much less: they must do\nwith commoner things, I suppose, and look after the scraps. It seems,\nmoney goes but a little way in these matters, for Wrench has everything\nas plain as possible, and he has a very large practice.”“Oh, if you think of living as the Wrenches do!” said Rosamond, with a\nlittle turn of her neck. “But I have heard you express your disgust at\nthat way of living.”“Yes, they have bad taste in everything—they make economy look ugly. We\nneedn’t do that. I only meant that they avoid expenses, although Wrench\nhas a capital practice.”“Why should not you have a good practice, Tertius? Mr. Peacock had. You\nshould be more careful not to offend people, and you should send out\nmedicines as the others do. I am sure you began well, and you got\nseveral good houses. It cannot answer to be eccentric; you should think\nwhat will be generally liked,” said Rosamond, in a decided little tone\nof admonition.Lydgate’s anger rose: he was prepared to be indulgent towards feminine\nweakness, but not towards feminine dictation. The shallowness of a\nwaternixie’s soul may have a charm until she becomes didactic. But he\ncontrolled himself, and only said, with a touch of despotic firmness—“What I am to do in my practice, Rosy, it is for me to judge. That is\nnot the question between us. It is enough for you to know that our\nincome is likely to be a very narrow one—hardly four hundred, perhaps\nless, for a long time to come, and we must try to re-arrange our lives\nin accordance with that fact.”Rosamond was silent for a moment or two, looking before her, and then\nsaid, “My uncle Bulstrode ought to allow you a salary for the time you\ngive to the Hospital: it is not right that you should work for\nnothing.”"

I have\npointed out what is the only probability,” said Lydgate, impatiently.\nThen checking himself, he went on more quietly—“I think I see one resource which would free us from a good deal of the\npresent difficulty. I hear that young Ned Plymdale is going to be\nmarried to Miss Sophy Toller. They are rich, and it is not often that a\ngood house is vacant in Middlemarch. I feel sure that they would be\nglad to take this house from us with most of our furniture, and they\nwould be willing to pay handsomely for the lease. I can employ Trumbull\nto speak to Plymdale about it.”Rosamond left her husband’s knee and walked slowly to the other end of\nthe room; when she turned round and walked towards him it was evident\nthat the tears had come, and that she was biting her under-lip and\nclasping her hands to keep herself from crying. Lydgate was\nwretched—shaken with anger and yet feeling that it would be unmanly to\nvent the anger just now.“I am very sorry, Rosamond; I know this is painful.”“I thought, at least, when I had borne to send the plate back and have\nthat man taking an inventory of the furniture—I should have thought\n_that_ would suffice.”“I explained it to you at the time, dear. That was only a security and\nbehind that security there is a debt. And that debt must be paid within\nthe next few months, else we shall have our furniture sold. If young\nPlymdale will take our house and most of our furniture, we shall be\nable to pay that debt, and some others too, and we shall be quit of a\nplace too expensive for us. We might take a smaller house: Trumbull, I\nknow, has a very decent one to let at thirty pounds a-year, and this is\nninety.” Lydgate uttered this speech in the curt hammering way with\nwhich we usually try to nail down a vague mind to imperative facts.\nTears rolled silently down Rosamond’s cheeks; she just pressed her\nhandkerchief against them, and stood looking at the large vase on the\nmantel-piece. It was a moment of more intense bitterness than she had\never felt before. At last she said, without hurry and with careful\nemphasis—"

  "content": "“I never could have believed that you would like to act in that way.”“Like it?” burst out Lydgate, rising from his chair, thrusting his\nhands in his pockets and stalking away from the hearth; “it’s not a\nquestion of liking. Of course, I don’t like it; it’s the only thing I\ncan do.” He wheeled round there, and turned towards her.“I should have thought there were many other means than that,” said\nRosamond. “Let us have a sale and leave Middlemarch altogether.”“To do what? What is the use of my leaving my work in Middlemarch to go\nwhere I have none? We should be just as penniless elsewhere as we are\nhere,” said Lydgate still more angrily.“If we are to be in that position it will be entirely your own doing,\nTertius,” said Rosamond, turning round to speak with the fullest\nconviction. “You will not behave as you ought to do to your own family.\nYou offended Captain Lydgate. Sir Godwin was very kind to me when we\nwere at Quallingham, and I am sure if you showed proper regard to him\nand told him your affairs, he would do anything for you. But rather\nthan that, you like giving up our house and furniture to Mr. Ned\nPlymdale.”There was something like fierceness in Lydgate’s eyes, as he answered\nwith new violence, “Well, then, if you will have it so, I do like it. I\nadmit that I like it better than making a fool of myself by going to\nbeg where it’s of no use. Understand then, that it is what I _like to\ndo._”There was a tone in the last sentence which was equivalent to the\nclutch of his strong hand on Rosamond’s delicate arm. But for all that,\nhis will was not a whit stronger than hers. She immediately walked out\nof the room in silence, but with an intense determination to hinder\nwhat Lydgate liked to do."

  "content": "He went out of the house, but as his blood cooled he felt that the\nchief result of the discussion was a deposit of dread within him at the\nidea of opening with his wife in future subjects which might again urge\nhim to violent speech. It was as if a fracture in delicate crystal had\nbegun, and he was afraid of any movement that might make it fatal. His\nmarriage would be a mere piece of bitter irony if they could not go on\nloving each other. He had long ago made up his mind to what he thought\nwas her negative character—her want of sensibility, which showed itself\nin disregard both of his specific wishes and of his general aims. The\nfirst great disappointment had been borne: the tender devotedness and\ndocile adoration of the ideal wife must be renounced, and life must be\ntaken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost\ntheir limbs. But the real wife had not only her claims, she had still a\nhold on his heart, and it was his intense desire that the hold should\nremain strong. In marriage, the certainty, “She will never love me\nmuch,” is easier to bear than the fear, “I shall love her no more.”\nHence, after that outburst, his inward effort was entirely to excuse\nher, and to blame the hard circumstances which were partly his fault.\nHe tried that evening, by petting her, to heal the wound he had made in\nthe morning, and it was not in Rosamond’s nature to be repellent or\nsulky; indeed, she welcomed the signs that her husband loved her and\nwas under control. But this was something quite distinct from loving\n_him_. Lydgate would not have chosen soon to recur to the plan of\nparting with the house; he was resolved to carry it out, and say as\nlittle more about it as possible. But Rosamond herself touched on it at\nbreakfast by saying, mildly—“Have you spoken to Trumbull yet?”“No,” said Lydgate, “but I shall call on him as I go by this morning.\nNo time must be lost.” He took Rosamond’s question as a sign that she\nwithdrew her inward opposition, and kissed her head caressingly when he\ngot up to go away.As soon as it was late enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs.\nPlymdale, Mr. Ned’s mother, and entered with pretty congratulations\ninto the subject of the coming marriage. Mrs. Plymdale’s maternal view\nwas, that Rosamond might possibly now have retrospective glimpses of\nher own folly; and feeling the advantages to be at present all on the\nside of her son, was too kind a woman not to behave graciously.“Yes, Ned is most happy, I must say. And Sophy Toller is all I could\ndesire in a daughter-in-law. Of course her father is able to do\nsomething handsome for her—that is only what would be expected with a\nbrewery like his. And the connection is everything we should desire.\nBut that is not what I look at. She is such a very nice girl—no airs,\nno pretensions, though on a level with the first. I don’t mean with the\ntitled aristocracy. I see very little good in people aiming out of\ntheir own sphere. I mean that Sophy is equal to the best in the town,\nand she is contented with that.”“I have always thought her very agreeable,” said Rosamond.“I look upon it as a reward for Ned, who never held his head too high,\nthat he should have got into the very best connection,” continued Mrs.\nPlymdale, her native sharpness softened by a fervid sense that she was\ntaking a correct view. “And such particular people as the Tollers are,\nthey might have objected because some of our friends are not theirs. It\nis well known that your aunt Bulstrode and I have been intimate from\nour youth, and Mr. Plymdale has been always on Mr. Bulstrode’s side.\nAnd I myself prefer serious opinions. But the Tollers have welcomed Ned\nall the same.”"

But I am thankful he has\nnot. It is a poor preparation both for here and Hereafter.”“Oh dear, yes; appearances have very little to do with happiness,” said\nRosamond. “I think there is every prospect of their being a happy\ncouple. What house will they take?”“Oh, as for that, they must put up with what they can get. They have\nbeen looking at the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s;\nit belongs to him, and he is putting it nicely in repair. I suppose\nthey are not likely to hear of a better. Indeed, I think Ned will\ndecide the matter to-day.”“I should think it is a nice house; I like St. Peter’s Place.”“Well, it is near the Church, and a genteel situation. But the windows\nare narrow, and it is all ups and downs. You don’t happen to know of\nany other that would be at liberty?” said Mrs. Plymdale, fixing her\nround black eyes on Rosamond with the animation of a sudden thought in\nthem.“Oh no; I hear so little of those things.”Rosamond had not foreseen that question and answer in setting out to\npay her visit; she had simply meant to gather any information which\nwould help her to avert the parting with her own house under\ncircumstances thoroughly disagreeable to her. As to the untruth in her\nreply, she no more reflected on it than she did on the untruth there\nwas in her saying that appearances had very little to do with\nhappiness. Her object, she was convinced, was thoroughly justifiable:\nit was Lydgate whose intention was inexcusable; and there was a plan in\nher mind which, when she had carried it out fully, would prove how very\nfalse a step it would have been for him to have descended from his\nposition."
