  "content": "Lydgate said no more, but went out on his rounds. He felt bruised and\nshattered, and there was a dark line under his eyes which Rosamond had\nnot seen before. She could not bear to look at him. Tertius had a way\nof taking things which made them a great deal worse for her.CHAPTER LXX.“Our deeds still travel with us from afar,\nAnd what we have been makes us what we are.”Bulstrode’s first object after Lydgate had left Stone Court was to\nexamine Raffles’s pockets, which he imagined were sure to carry signs\nin the shape of hotel-bills of the places he had stopped in, if he had\nnot told the truth in saying that he had come straight from Liverpool\nbecause he was ill and had no money. There were various bills crammed\ninto his pocketbook, but none of a later date than Christmas at any\nother place, except one, which bore date that morning. This was\ncrumpled up with a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his\ntail-pockets, and represented the cost of three days’ stay at an inn at\nBilkley, where the fair was held—a town at least forty miles from\nMiddlemarch. The bill was heavy, and since Raffles had no luggage with\nhim, it seemed probable that he had left his portmanteau behind in\npayment, in order to save money for his travelling fare; for his purse\nwas empty, and he had only a couple of sixpences and some loose pence\nin his pockets."

  "content": "Bulstrode gathered a sense of safety from these indications that\nRaffles had really kept at a distance from Middlemarch since his\nmemorable visit at Christmas. At a distance and among people who were\nstrangers to Bulstrode, what satisfaction could there be to Raffles’s\ntormenting, self-magnifying vein in telling old scandalous stories\nabout a Middlemarch banker? And what harm if he did talk? The chief\npoint now was to keep watch over him as long as there was any danger of\nthat intelligible raving, that unaccountable impulse to tell, which\nseemed to have acted towards Caleb Garth; and Bulstrode felt much\nanxiety lest some such impulse should come over him at the sight of\nLydgate. He sat up alone with him through the night, only ordering the\nhousekeeper to lie down in her clothes, so as to be ready when he\ncalled her, alleging his own indisposition to sleep, and his anxiety to\ncarry out the doctor’s orders. He did carry them out faithfully,\nalthough Raffles was incessantly asking for brandy, and declaring that\nhe was sinking away—that the earth was sinking away from under him. He\nwas restless and sleepless, but still quailing and manageable. On the\noffer of the food ordered by Lydgate, which he refused, and the denial\nof other things which he demanded, he seemed to concentrate all his\nterror on Bulstrode, imploringly deprecating his anger, his revenge on\nhim by starvation, and declaring with strong oaths that he had never\ntold any mortal a word against him. Even this Bulstrode felt that he\nwould not have liked Lydgate to hear; but a more alarming sign of\nfitful alternation in his delirium was, that in-the morning twilight\nRaffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor present, addressing him and\ndeclaring that Bulstrode wanted to starve him to death out of revenge\nfor telling, when he never had told.Bulstrode’s native imperiousness and strength of determination served\nhim well. This delicate-looking man, himself nervously perturbed, found\nthe needed stimulus in his strenuous circumstances, and through that\ndifficult night and morning, while he had the air of an animated corpse\nreturned to movement without warmth, holding the mastery by its chill\nimpassibility, his mind was intensely at work thinking of what he had\nto guard against and what would win him security. Whatever prayers he\nmight lift up, whatever statements he might inwardly make of this man’s\nwretched spiritual condition, and the duty he himself was under to\nsubmit to the punishment divinely appointed for him rather than to wish\nfor evil to another—through all this effort to condense words into a\nsolid mental state, there pierced and spread with irresistible\nvividness the images of the events he desired. And in the train of\nthose images came their apology. He could not but see the death of\nRaffles, and see in it his own deliverance. What was the removal of\nthis wretched creature? He was impenitent—but were not public criminals\nimpenitent?—yet the law decided on their fate. Should Providence in\nthis case award death, there was no sin in contemplating death as the\ndesirable issue—if he kept his hands from hastening it—if he\nscrupulously did what was prescribed. Even here there might be a\nmistake: human prescriptions were fallible things: Lydgate had said\nthat treatment had hastened death,—why not his own method of treatment?\nBut of course intention was everything in the question of right and\nwrong."

  "content": "And Bulstrode set himself to keep his intention separate from his\ndesire. He inwardly declared that he intended to obey orders. Why\nshould he have got into any argument about the validity of these\norders? It was only the common trick of desire—which avails itself of\nany irrelevant scepticism, finding larger room for itself in all\nuncertainty about effects, in every obscurity that looks like the\nabsence of law. Still, he did obey the orders.His anxieties continually glanced towards Lydgate, and his remembrance\nof what had taken place between them the morning before was accompanied\nwith sensibilities which had not been roused at all during the actual\nscene. He had then cared but little about Lydgate’s painful impressions\nwith regard to the suggested change in the Hospital, or about the\ndisposition towards himself which what he held to be his justifiable\nrefusal of a rather exorbitant request might call forth. He recurred to\nthe scene now with a perception that he had probably made Lydgate his\nenemy, and with an awakened desire to propitiate him, or rather to\ncreate in him a strong sense of personal obligation. He regretted that\nhe had not at once made even an unreasonable money-sacrifice. For in\ncase of unpleasant suspicions, or even knowledge gathered from the\nraving of Raffles, Bulstrode would have felt that he had a defence in\nLydgate’s mind by having conferred a momentous benefit on him. But the\nregret had perhaps come too late.Strange, piteous conflict in the soul of this unhappy man, who had\nlonged for years to be better than he was—who had taken his selfish\npassions into discipline and clad them in severe robes, so that he had\nwalked with them as a devout choir, till now that a terror had risen\namong them, and they could chant no longer, but threw out their common\ncries for safety.It was nearly the middle of the day before Lydgate arrived: he had\nmeant to come earlier, but had been detained, he said; and his\nshattered looks were noticed by Balstrode. But he immediately threw\nhimself into the consideration of the patient, and inquired strictly\ninto all that had occurred. Raffles was worse, would take hardly any\nfood, was persistently wakeful and restlessly raving; but still not\nviolent. Contrary to Bulstrode’s alarmed expectation, he took little\nnotice of Lydgate’s presence, and continued to talk or murmur\nincoherently.“What do you think of him?” said Bulstrode, in private."

  "content": "“The symptoms are worse.”“You are less hopeful?”“No; I still think he may come round. Are you going to stay here\nyourself?” said Lydgate, looking at Bulstrode with an abrupt question,\nwhich made him uneasy, though in reality it was not due to any\nsuspicious conjecture.“Yes, I think so,” said Bulstrode, governing himself and speaking with\ndeliberation. “Mrs. Bulstrode is advised of the reasons which detain\nme. Mrs. Abel and her husband are not experienced enough to be left\nquite alone, and this kind of responsibility is scarcely included in\ntheir service of me. You have some fresh instructions, I presume.”The chief new instruction that Lydgate had to give was on the\nadministration of extremely moderate doses of opium, in case of the\nsleeplessness continuing after several hours. He had taken the\nprecaution of bringing opium in his pocket, and he gave minute\ndirections to Bulstrode as to the doses, and the point at which they\nshould cease. He insisted on the risk of not ceasing; and repeated his\norder that no alcohol should be given.“From what I see of the case,” he ended, “narcotism is the only thing I\nshould be much afraid of. He may wear through even without much food.\nThere’s a good deal of strength in him.”“You look ill yourself, Mr. Lydgate—a most unusual, I may say\nunprecedented thing in my knowledge of you,” said Bulstrode, showing a\nsolicitude as unlike his indifference the day before, as his present\nrecklessness about his own fatigue was unlike his habitual\nself-cherishing anxiety. “I fear you are harassed.”“Yes, I am,” said Lydgate, brusquely, holding his hat, and ready to go.“Something new, I fear,” said Bulstrode, inquiringly. “Pray be seated.”“No, thank you,” said Lydgate, with some hauteur. “I mentioned to you\nyesterday what was the state of my affairs. There is nothing to add,\nexcept that the execution has since then been actually put into my\nhouse. One can tell a good deal of trouble in a short sentence. I will\nsay good morning.”"

  "content": "“Stay, Mr. Lydgate, stay,” said Bulstrode; “I have been reconsidering\nthis subject. I was yesterday taken by surprise, and saw it\nsuperficially. Mrs. Bulstrode is anxious for her niece, and I myself\nshould grieve at a calamitous change in your position. Claims on me are\nnumerous, but on reconsideration, I esteem it right that I should incur\na small sacrifice rather than leave you unaided. You said, I think,\nthat a thousand pounds would suffice entirely to free you from your\nburthens, and enable you to recover a firm stand?”“Yes,” said Lydgate, a great leap of joy within him surmounting every\nother feeling; “that would pay all my debts, and leave me a little on\nhand. I could set about economizing in our way of living. And by-and-by\nmy practice might look up.”“If you will wait a moment, Mr. Lydgate, I will draw a check to that\namount. I am aware that help, to be effectual in these cases, should be\nthorough.”While Bulstrode wrote, Lydgate turned to the window thinking of his\nhome—thinking of his life with its good start saved from frustration,\nits good purposes still unbroken.“You can give me a note of hand for this, Mr. Lydgate,” said the\nbanker, advancing towards him with the check. “And by-and-by, I hope,\nyou may be in circumstances gradually to repay me. Meanwhile, I have\npleasure in thinking that you will be released from further\ndifficulty.”“I am deeply obliged to you,” said Lydgate. “You have restored to me\nthe prospect of working with some happiness and some chance of good.”It appeared to him a very natural movement in Bulstrode that he should\nhave reconsidered his refusal: it corresponded with the more munificent\nside of his character. But as he put his hack into a canter, that he\nmight get the sooner home, and tell the good news to Rosamond, and get\ncash at the bank to pay over to Dover’s agent, there crossed his mind,\nwith an unpleasant impression, as from a dark-winged flight of evil\naugury across his vision, the thought of that contrast in himself which\na few months had brought—that he should be overjoyed at being under a\nstrong personal obligation—that he should be overjoyed at getting money\nfor himself from Bulstrode."

  "content": "The banker felt that he had done something to nullify one cause of\nuneasiness, and yet he was scarcely the easier. He did not measure the\nquantity of diseased motive which had made him wish for Lydgate’s\ngood-will, but the quantity was none the less actively there, like an\nirritating agent in his blood. A man vows, and yet will not cast away\nthe means of breaking his vow. Is it that he distinctly means to break\nit? Not at all; but the desires which tend to break it are at work in\nhim dimly, and make their way into his imagination, and relax his\nmuscles in the very moments when he is telling himself over again the\nreasons for his vow. Raffles, recovering quickly, returning to the free\nuse of his odious powers—how could Bulstrode wish for that? Raffles\ndead was the image that brought release, and indirectly he prayed for\nthat way of release, beseeching that, if it were possible, the rest of\nhis days here below might be freed from the threat of an ignominy which\nwould break him utterly as an instrument of God’s service. Lydgate’s\nopinion was not on the side of promise that this prayer would be\nfulfilled; and as the day advanced, Bulstrode felt himself getting\nirritated at the persistent life in this man, whom he would fain have\nseen sinking into the silence of death: imperious will stirred\nmurderous impulses towards this brute life, over which will, by itself,\nhad no power. He said inwardly that he was getting too much worn; he\nwould not sit up with the patient to-night, but leave him to Mrs. Abel,\nwho, if necessary, could call her husband.At six o’clock, Raffles, having had only fitful perturbed snatches of\nsleep, from which he waked with fresh restlessness and perpetual cries\nthat he was sinking away, Bulstrode began to administer the opium\naccording to Lydgate’s directions. At the end of half an hour or more\nhe called Mrs. Abel and told her that he found himself unfit for\nfurther watching. He must now consign the patient to her care; and he\nproceeded to repeat to her Lydgate’s directions as to the quantity of\neach dose. Mrs. Abel had not before known anything of Lydgate’s\nprescriptions; she had simply prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode\nordered, and had done what he pointed out to her. She began now to ask\nwhat else she should do besides administering the opium.“Nothing at present, except the offer of the soup or the soda-water:\nyou can come to me for further directions. Unless there is any\nimportant change, I shall not come into the room again to-night. You\nwill ask your husband for help if necessary. I must go to bed early.”“You’ve much need, sir, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Abel, “and to take\nsomething more strengthening than what you’ve done.”"

  "content": "Bulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might say in\nhis raving, which had taken on a muttering incoherence not likely to\ncreate any dangerous belief. At any rate he must risk this. He went\ndown into the wainscoted parlor first, and began to consider whether he\nwould not have his horse saddled and go home by the moonlight, and give\nup caring for earthly consequences. Then, he wished that he had begged\nLydgate to come again that evening. Perhaps he might deliver a\ndifferent opinion, and think that Raffles was getting into a less\nhopeful state. Should he send for Lydgate? If Raffles were really\ngetting worse, and slowly dying, Bulstrode felt that he could go to bed\nand sleep in gratitude to Providence. But was he worse? Lydgate might\ncome and simply say that he was going on as he expected, and predict\nthat he would by-and-by fall into a good sleep, and get well. What was\nthe use of sending for him? Bulstrode shrank from that result. No ideas\nor opinions could hinder him from seeing the one probability to be,\nthat Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before, with his\nstrength as a tormentor renewed, obliging him to drag away his wife to\nspend her years apart from her friends and native place, carrying an\nalienating suspicion against him in her heart.He had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight only,\nwhen a sudden thought made him rise and light the bed-candle, which he\nhad brought down with him. The thought was, that he had not told Mrs.\nAbel when the doses of opium must cease.He took hold of the candlestick, but stood motionless for a long while.\nShe might already have given him more than Lydgate had prescribed. But\nit was excusable in him, that he should forget part of an order, in his\npresent wearied condition. He walked up-stairs, candle in hand, not\nknowing whether he should straightway enter his own room and go to bed,\nor turn to the patient’s room and rectify his omission. He paused in\nthe passage, with his face turned towards Raffles’s room, and he could\nhear him moaning and murmuring. He was not asleep, then. Who could know\nthat Lydgate’s prescription would not be better disobeyed than\nfollowed, since there was still no sleep?He turned into his own room. Before he had quite undressed, Mrs. Abel\nrapped at the door; he opened it an inch, so that he could hear her\nspeak low.“If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the\npoor creetur? He feels sinking away, and nothing else will he\nswaller—and but little strength in it, if he did—only the opium. And he\nsays more and more he’s sinking down through the earth.”To her surprise, Mr. Bulstrode did not answer. A struggle was going on\nwithin him.“I think he must die for want o’ support, if he goes on in that way.\nWhen I nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I had to give him port-wine\nand brandy constant, and a big glass at a time,” added Mrs. Abel, with\na touch of remonstrance in her tone.But again Mr. Bulstrode did not answer immediately, and she continued,\n“It’s not a time to spare when people are at death’s door, nor would\nyou wish it, sir, I’m sure. Else I should give him our own bottle o’\nrum as we keep by us. But a sitter-up so as you’ve been, and doing\neverything as laid in your power—”"

  "content": "Here a key was thrust through the inch of doorway, and Mr. Bulstrode\nsaid huskily, “That is the key of the wine-cooler. You will find plenty\nof brandy there.”Early in the morning—about six—Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some time\nin prayer. Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily\ncandid—necessarily goes to the roots of action? Private prayer is\ninaudible speech, and speech is representative: who can represent\nhimself just as he is, even in his own reflections? Bulstrode had not\nyet unravelled in his thought the confused promptings of the last\nfour-and-twenty hours.He listened in the passage, and could hear hard stertorous breathing.\nThen he walked out in the garden, and looked at the early rime on the\ngrass and fresh spring leaves. When he re-entered the house, he felt\nstartled at the sight of Mrs. Abel.“How is your patient—asleep, I think?” he said, with an attempt at\ncheerfulness in his tone.“He’s gone very deep, sir,” said Mrs. Abel. “He went off gradual\nbetween three and four o’clock. Would you please to go and look at him?\nI thought it no harm to leave him. My man’s gone afield, and the little\ngirl’s seeing to the kettles.”Bulstrode went up. At a glance he knew that Raffles was not in the\nsleep which brings revival, but in the sleep which streams deeper and\ndeeper into the gulf of death.He looked round the room and saw a bottle with some brandy in it, and\nthe almost empty opium phial. He put the phial out of sight, and\ncarried the brandy-bottle down-stairs with him, locking it again in the\nwine-cooler.While breakfasting he considered whether he should ride to Middlemarch\nat once, or wait for Lydgate’s arrival. He decided to wait, and told\nMrs. Abel that she might go about her work—he could watch in the\nbed-chamber."

  "content": "As he sat there and beheld the enemy of his peace going irrevocably\ninto silence, he felt more at rest than he had done for many months.\nHis conscience was soothed by the enfolding wing of secrecy, which\nseemed just then like an angel sent down for his relief. He drew out\nhis pocket-book to review various memoranda there as to the\narrangements he had projected and partly carried out in the prospect of\nquitting Middlemarch, and considered how far he would let them stand or\nrecall them, now that his absence would be brief. Some economies which\nhe felt desirable might still find a suitable occasion in his temporary\nwithdrawal from management, and he hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would\ntake a large share in the expenses of the Hospital. In that way the\nmoments passed, until a change in the stertorous breathing was marked\nenough to draw his attention wholly to the bed, and forced him to think\nof the departing life, which had once been subservient to his own—which\nhe had once been glad to find base enough for him to act on as he\nwould. It was his gladness then which impelled him now to be glad that\nthe life was at an end.And who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened? Who knew\nwhat would have saved him?Lydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final pause of\nthe breath. When he entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden\nexpression in his face, which was not so much surprise as a recognition\nthat he had not judged correctly. He stood by the bed in silence for\nsome time, with his eyes turned on the dying man, but with that subdued\nactivity of expression which showed that he was carrying on an inward\ndebate.“When did this change begin?” said he, looking at Bulstrode.“I did not watch by him last night,” said Bulstrode. “I was over-worn,\nand left him under Mrs. Abel’s care. She said that he sank into sleep\nbetween three and four o’clock. When I came in before eight he was\nnearly in this condition.”Lydgate did not ask another question, but watched in silence until he\nsaid, “It’s all over.”This morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and freedom. He\nhad set out on his work with all his old animation, and felt himself\nstrong enough to bear all the deficiencies of his married life. And he\nwas conscious that Bulstrode had been a benefactor to him. But he was\nuneasy about this case. He had not expected it to terminate as it had\ndone. Yet he hardly knew how to put a question on the subject to\nBulstrode without appearing to insult him; and if he examined the\nhousekeeper—why, the man was dead. There seemed to be no use in\nimplying that somebody’s ignorance or imprudence had killed him. And\nafter all, he himself might be wrong."

  "content": "He and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together, talking of many\nthings—chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in the House\nof Lords, and the firm resolve of the political Unions. Nothing was\nsaid about Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of\nhaving a grave for him in Lowick churchyard, and observed that, so far\nas he knew, the poor man had no connections, except Rigg, whom he had\nstated to be unfriendly towards him.On returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother. The Vicar\nhad not been in the town the day before, but the news that there was an\nexecution in Lydgate’s house had got to Lowick by the evening, having\nbeen carried by Mr. Spicer, shoemaker and parish-clerk, who had it from\nhis brother, the respectable bell-hanger in Lowick Gate. Since that\nevening when Lydgate had come down from the billiard room with Fred\nVincy, Mr. Farebrother’s thoughts about him had been rather gloomy.\nPlaying at the Green Dragon once or oftener might have been a trifle in\nanother man; but in Lydgate it was one of several signs that he was\ngetting unlike his former self. He was beginning to do things for which\nhe had formerly even an excessive scorn. Whatever certain\ndissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had\ngiven him hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother\nfelt sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being\nmore and more distinctly reported, and he began to fear that any notion\nof Lydgate’s having resources or friends in the background must be\nquite illusory. The rebuff he had met with in his first attempt to win\nLydgate’s confidence, disinclined him to a second; but this news of the\nexecution being actually in the house, determined the Vicar to overcome\nhis reluctance.Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom he was much\ninterested, and he came forward to put out his hand—with an open\ncheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother. Could this too be a proud\nrejection of sympathy and help? Never mind; the sympathy and help\nshould be offered.“How are you, Lydgate? I came to see you because I had heard something\nwhich made me anxious about you,” said the Vicar, in the tone of a good\nbrother, only that there was no reproach in it. They were both seated\nby this time, and Lydgate answered immediately—“I think I know what you mean. You had heard that there was an\nexecution in the house?”“Yes; is it true?”"

I am out of my difficulties now: I shall be freed from debts, and\nable, I hope, to start afresh on a better plan.”“I am very thankful to hear it,” said the Vicar, falling back in his\nchair, and speaking with that low-toned quickness which often follows\nthe removal of a load. “I like that better than all the news in the\n‘Times.’ I confess I came to you with a heavy heart.”“Thank you for coming,” said Lydgate, cordially. “I can enjoy the\nkindness all the more because I am happier. I have certainly been a\ngood deal crushed. I’m afraid I shall find the bruises still painful\nby-and by,” he added, smiling rather sadly; “but just now I can only\nfeel that the torture-screw is off.”Mr. Farebrother was silent for a moment, and then said earnestly, “My\ndear fellow, let me ask you one question. Forgive me if I take a\nliberty.”“I don’t believe you will ask anything that ought to offend me.”“Then—this is necessary to set my heart quite at rest—you have not—have\nyou?—in order to pay your debts, incurred another debt which may harass\nyou worse hereafter?”“No,” said Lydgate, coloring slightly. “There is no reason why I should\nnot tell you—since the fact is so—that the person to whom I am indebted\nis Bulstrode. He has made me a very handsome advance—a thousand\npounds—and he can afford to wait for repayment.”“Well, that is generous,” said Mr. Farebrother, compelling himself to\napprove of the man whom he disliked. His delicate feeling shrank from\ndwelling even in his thought on the fact that he had always urged\nLydgate to avoid any personal entanglement with Bulstrode. He added\nimmediately, “And Bulstrode must naturally feel an interest in your\nwelfare, after you have worked with him in a way which has probably\nreduced your income instead of adding to it. I am glad to think that he\nhas acted accordingly.”"

They made\nmore distinct within him the uneasy consciousness which had shown its\nfirst dim stirrings only a few hours before, that Bulstrode’s motives\nfor his sudden beneficence following close upon the chillest\nindifference might be merely selfish. He let the kindly suppositions\npass. He could not tell the history of the loan, but it was more\nvividly present with him than ever, as well as the fact which the Vicar\ndelicately ignored—that this relation of personal indebtedness to\nBulstrode was what he had once been most resolved to avoid.He began, instead of answering, to speak of his projected economies,\nand of his having come to look at his life from a different point of\nview.“I shall set up a surgery,” he said. “I really think I made a mistaken\neffort in that respect.

  "content": "Five days after the death of Raffles, Mr. Bambridge was standing at his\nleisure under the large archway leading into the yard of the Green\nDragon. He was not fond of solitary contemplation, but he had only just\ncome out of the house, and any human figure standing at ease under the\narchway in the early afternoon was as certain to attract companionship\nas a pigeon which has found something worth pecking at. In this case\nthere was no material object to feed upon, but the eye of reason saw a\nprobability of mental sustenance in the shape of gossip. Mr. Hopkins,\nthe meek-mannered draper opposite, was the first to act on this inward\nvision, being the more ambitious of a little masculine talk because his\ncustomers were chiefly women. Mr. Bambridge was rather curt to the\ndraper, feeling that Hopkins was of course glad to talk to _him_, but\nthat he was not going to waste much of his talk on Hopkins. Soon,\nhowever, there was a small cluster of more important listeners, who\nwere either deposited from the passers-by, or had sauntered to the spot\nexpressly to see if there were anything going on at the Green Dragon;\nand Mr. Bambridge was finding it worth his while to say many impressive\nthings about the fine studs he had been seeing and the purchases he had\nmade on a journey in the north from which he had just returned.\nGentlemen present were assured that when they could show him anything\nto cut out a blood mare, a bay, rising four, which was to be seen at\nDoncaster if they chose to go and look at it, Mr. Bambridge would\ngratify them by being shot “from here to Hereford.” Also, a pair of\nblacks which he was going to put into the break recalled vividly to his\nmind a pair which he had sold to Faulkner in ’19, for a hundred\nguineas, and which Faulkner had sold for a hundred and sixty two months\nlater—any gent who could disprove this statement being offered the\nprivilege of calling Mr. Bambridge by a very ugly name until the\nexercise made his throat dry.When the discourse was at this point of animation, came up Mr. Frank\nHawley. He was not a man to compromise his dignity by lounging at the\nGreen Dragon, but happening to pass along the High Street and seeing\nBambridge on the other side, he took some of his long strides across to\nask the horsedealer whether he had found the first-rate gig-horse which\nhe had engaged to look for. Mr. Hawley was requested to wait until he\nhad seen a gray selected at Bilkley: if that did not meet his wishes to\na hair, Bambridge did not know a horse when he saw it, which seemed to\nbe the highest conceivable unlikelihood. Mr. Hawley, standing with his\nback to the street, was fixing a time for looking at the gray and\nseeing it tried, when a horseman passed slowly by.“Bulstrode!” said two or three voices at once in a low tone, one of\nthem, which was the draper’s, respectfully prefixing the “Mr.;” but\nnobody having more intention in this interjectural naming than if they\nhad said “the Riverston coach” when that vehicle appeared in the\ndistance. Mr. Hawley gave a careless glance round at Bulstrode’s back,\nbut as Bambridge’s eyes followed it he made a sarcastic grimace.“By jingo! that reminds me,” he began, lowering his voice a little, “I\npicked up something else at Bilkley besides your gig-horse, Mr. Hawley.\nI picked up a fine story about Bulstrode. Do you know how he came by\nhis fortune? Any gentleman wanting a bit of curious information, I can\ngive it him free of expense. If everybody got their deserts, Bulstrode\nmight have had to say his prayers at Botany Bay.”“What do you mean?” said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his hands into his\npockets, and pushing a little forward under the archway. If Bulstrode\nshould turn out to be a rascal, Frank Hawley had a prophetic soul."

  "content": "“I had it from a party who was an old chum of Bulstrode’s. I’ll tell\nyou where I first picked him up,” said Bambridge, with a sudden gesture\nof his fore-finger. “He was at Larcher’s sale, but I knew nothing of\nhim then—he slipped through my fingers—was after Bulstrode, no doubt.\nHe tells me he can tap Bulstrode to any amount, knows all his secrets.\nHowever, he blabbed to me at Bilkley: he takes a stiff glass. Damme if\nI think he meant to turn king’s evidence; but he’s that sort of\nbragging fellow, the bragging runs over hedge and ditch with him, till\nhe’d brag of a spavin as if it ’ud fetch money. A man should know when\nto pull up.” Mr. Bambridge made this remark with an air of disgust,\nsatisfied that his own bragging showed a fine sense of the marketable.“What’s the man’s name? Where can he be found?” said Mr. Hawley.“As to where he is to be found, I left him to it at the Saracen’s Head;\nbut his name is Raffles.”“Raffles!” exclaimed Mr. Hopkins. “I furnished his funeral yesterday.\nHe was buried at Lowick. Mr. Bulstrode followed him. A very decent\nfuneral.” There was a strong sensation among the listeners. Mr.\nBambridge gave an ejaculation in which “brimstone” was the mildest\nword, and Mr. Hawley, knitting his brows and bending his head forward,\nexclaimed, “What?—where did the man die?”“At Stone Court,” said the draper. “The housekeeper said he was a\nrelation of the master’s. He came there ill on Friday.”“Why, it was on Wednesday I took a glass with him,” interposed\nBambridge.“Did any doctor attend him?” said Mr. Hawley“Yes. Mr. Lydgate. Mr. Bulstrode sat up with him one night. He died the\nthird morning.”“Go on, Bambridge,” said Mr. Hawley, insistently. “What did this fellow\nsay about Bulstrode?”The group had already become larger, the town-clerk’s presence being a\nguarantee that something worth listening to was going on there; and Mr.\nBambridge delivered his narrative in the hearing of seven. It was\nmainly what we know, including the fact about Will Ladislaw, with some\nlocal color and circumstance added: it was what Bulstrode had dreaded\nthe betrayal of—and hoped to have buried forever with the corpse of\nRaffles—it was that haunting ghost of his earlier life which as he rode\npast the archway of the Green Dragon he was trusting that Providence\nhad delivered him from. Yes, Providence. He had not confessed to\nhimself yet that he had done anything in the way of contrivance to this\nend; he had accepted what seemed to have been offered. It was\nimpossible to prove that he had done anything which hastened the\ndeparture of that man’s soul."

  "content": "But this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like the\nsmell of fire. Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his information by sending\na clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring\nabout hay, but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles\nand his illness from Mrs. Abel. In this way it came to his knowledge\nthat Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig; and Mr.\nHawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at\nhis office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it\nwere required, and then asking him incidentally about Raffles. Caleb\nwas betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which\nhe was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the\nlast week. Mr Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that\nRaffles had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up\nBulstrode’s affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr.\nToller. The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp\nof an inference, and was taken as information coming straight from\nGarth, so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to\nbe the chief publisher of Bulstrode’s misdemeanors.Mr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for the\nlaw either in the revelations made by Raffles or in the circumstances\nof his death. He had himself ridden to Lowick village that he might\nlook at the register and talk over the whole matter with Mr.\nFarebrother, who was not more surprised than the lawyer that an ugly\nsecret should have come to light about Bulstrode, though he had always\nhad justice enough in him to hinder his antipathy from turning into\nconclusions. But while they were talking another combination was\nsilently going forward in Mr. Farebrother’s mind, which foreshadowed\nwhat was soon to be loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary\n“putting of two and two together.” With the reasons which kept\nBulstrode in dread of Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread\nmight have something to do with his munificence towards his medical\nman; and though he resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously\naccepted in any way as a bribe, he had a foreboding that this\ncomplication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate’s\nreputation. He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of the\nsudden relief from debt, and he himself was careful to glide away from\nall approaches towards the subject.“Well,” he said, with a deep breath, wanting to wind up the illimitable\ndiscussion of what might have been, though nothing could be legally\nproven, “it is a strange story. So our mercurial Ladislaw has a queer\ngenealogy! A high-spirited young lady and a musical Polish patriot made\na likely enough stock for him to spring from, but I should never have\nsuspected a grafting of the Jew pawnbroker. However, there’s no knowing\nwhat a mixture will turn out beforehand. Some sorts of dirt serve to\nclarify.”“It’s just what I should have expected,” said Mr. Hawley, mounting his\nhorse. “Any cursed alien blood, Jew, Corsican, or Gypsy.”"

  "content": "“I know he’s one of your black sheep, Hawley. But he is really a\ndisinterested, unworldly fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.“Ay, ay, that is your Whiggish twist,” said Mr. Hawley, who had been in\nthe habit of saying apologetically that Farebrother was such a damned\npleasant good-hearted fellow you would mistake him for a Tory.Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate’s attendance on\nRaffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of\nBulstrode. But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able not\nonly to get rid of the execution in his house but to pay all his debts\nin Middlemarch was spreading fast, gathering round it conjectures and\ncomments which gave it new body and impetus, and soon filling the ears\nof other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were not slow to see a\nsignificant relation between this sudden command of money and\nBulstrode’s desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles. That the money\ncame from Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there\nhad been no direct evidence of it; for it had beforehand entered into\nthe gossip about Lydgate’s affairs, that neither his father-in-law nor\nhis own family would do anything for him, and direct evidence was\nfurnished not only by a clerk at the Bank, but by innocent Mrs.\nBulstrode herself, who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale, who\nmentioned it to her daughter-in-law of the house of Toller, who\nmentioned it generally. The business was felt to be so public and\nimportant that it required dinners to feed it, and many invitations\nwere just then issued and accepted on the strength of this scandal\nconcerning Bulstrode and Lydgate; wives, widows, and single ladies took\ntheir work and went out to tea oftener than usual; and all public\nconviviality, from the Green Dragon to Dollop’s, gathered a zest which\ncould not be won from the question whether the Lords would throw out\nthe Reform Bill."

  "content": "For hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at\nthe bottom of Bulstrode’s liberality to Lydgate. Mr. Hawley indeed, in\nthe first instance, invited a select party, including the two\nphysicians, with Mr Toller and Mr. Wrench, expressly to hold a close\ndiscussion as to the probabilities of Raffles’s illness, reciting to\nthem all the particulars which had been gathered from Mrs. Abel in\nconnection with Lydgate’s certificate, that the death was due to\ndelirium tremens; and the medical gentlemen, who all stood\nundisturbedly on the old paths in relation to this disease, declared\nthat they could see nothing in these particulars which could be\ntransformed into a positive ground of suspicion. But the moral grounds\nof suspicion remained: the strong motives Bulstrode clearly had for\nwishing to be rid of Raffles, and the fact that at this critical moment\nhe had given Lydgate the help which he must for some time have known\nthe need for; the disposition, moreover, to believe that Bulstrode\nwould be unscrupulous, and the absence of any indisposition to believe\nthat Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty-minded men when\nthey have found themselves in want of money. Even if the money had been\ngiven merely to make him hold his tongue about the scandal of\nBulstrode’s earlier life, the fact threw an odious light on Lydgate,\nwho had long been sneered at as making himself subservient to the\nbanker for the sake of working himself into predominance, and\ndiscrediting the elder members of his profession. Hence, in spite of\nthe negative as to any direct sign of guilt in relation to the death at\nStone Court, Mr. Hawley’s select party broke up with the sense that the\naffair had “an ugly look.”But this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt, which was enough to\nkeep up much head-shaking and biting innuendo even among substantial\nprofessional seniors, had for the general mind all the superior power\nof mystery over fact. Everybody liked better to conjecture how the\nthing was, than simply to know it; for conjecture soon became more\nconfident than knowledge, and had a more liberal allowance for the\nincompatible. Even the more definite scandal concerning Bulstrode’s\nearlier life was, for some minds, melted into the mass of mystery, as\nso much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue, and to take such\nfantastic shapes as heaven pleased.This was the tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by Mrs. Dollop, the\nspirited landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane, who had often to\nresist the shallow pragmatism of customers disposed to think that their\nreports from the outer world were of equal force with what had “come\nup” in her mind. How it had been brought to her she didn’t know, but it\nwas there before her as if it had been “scored with the chalk on the\nchimney-board—” as Bulstrode should say, “his inside was _that black_\nas if the hairs of his head knowed the thoughts of his heart, he’d tear\n’em up by the roots.”“That’s odd,” said Mr. Limp, a meditative shoemaker, with weak eyes and\na piping voice. “Why, I read in the ‘Trumpet’ that was what the Duke of\nWellington said when he turned his coat and went over to the Romans.”“Very like,” said Mrs. Dollop. “If one raskill said it, it’s more\nreason why another should. But hypo_crite_ as he’s been, and holding\nthings with that high hand, as there was no parson i’ the country good\nenough for him, he was forced to take Old Harry into his counsel, and\nOld Harry’s been too many for him.”"

Mr. Thesiger is turned against him, and wants him\nout o’ the parish. And there’s gentlemen in this town says they’d as\nsoon dine with a fellow from the hulks. ‘And a deal sooner I would,’\nsays Fletcher; ‘for what’s more against one’s stomach than a man coming\nand making himself bad company with his religion, and giving out as the\nTen Commandments are not enough for him, and all the while he’s worse\nthan half the men at the tread-mill?’ Fletcher said so himself.”“It’ll be a bad thing for the town though, if Bulstrode’s money goes\nout of it,” said Mr. Limp, quaveringly.“Ah, there’s better folks spend their money worse,” said a firm-voiced\ndyer, whose crimson hands looked out of keeping with his good-natured\nface.“But he won’t keep his money, by what I can make out,” said the\nglazier. “Don’t they say as there’s somebody can strip it off him? By\nwhat I can understan’, they could take every penny off him, if they\nwent to lawing.”“No such thing!” said the barber, who felt himself a little above his\ncompany at Dollop’s, but liked it none the worse. “Fletcher says it’s\nno such thing. He says they might prove over and over again whose child\nthis young Ladislaw was, and they’d do no more than if they proved I\ncame out of the Fens—he couldn’t touch a penny.”"

  "content": "“Look you there now!” said Mrs. Dollop, indignantly. “I thank the Lord\nhe took my children to Himself, if that’s all the law can do for the\nmotherless. Then by that, it’s o’ no use who your father and mother is.\nBut as to listening to what one lawyer says without asking another—I\nwonder at a man o’ your cleverness, Mr. Dill. It’s well known there’s\nalways two sides, if no more; else who’d go to law, I should like to\nknow? It’s a poor tale, with all the law as there is up and down, if\nit’s no use proving whose child you are. Fletcher may say that if he\nlikes, but I say, don’t Fletcher _me_!”Mr. Dill affected to laugh in a complimentary way at Mrs. Dollop, as a\nwoman who was more than a match for the lawyers; being disposed to\nsubmit to much twitting from a landlady who had a long score against\nhim.“If they come to lawing, and it’s all true as folks say, there’s more\nto be looked to nor money,” said the glazier. “There’s this poor\ncreetur as is dead and gone; by what I can make out, he’d seen the day\nwhen he was a deal finer gentleman nor Bulstrode.”“Finer gentleman! I’ll warrant him,” said Mrs. Dollop; “and a far\npersonabler man, by what I can hear. As I said when Mr. Baldwin, the\ntax-gatherer, comes in, a-standing where you sit, and says, ‘Bulstrode\ngot all his money as he brought into this town by thieving and\nswindling,’—I said, ‘You don’t make me no wiser, Mr. Baldwin: it’s set\nmy blood a-creeping to look at him ever sin’ here he came into\nSlaughter Lane a-wanting to buy the house over my head: folks don’t\nlook the color o’ the dough-tub and stare at you as if they wanted to\nsee into your backbone for nothingk.’ That was what I said, and Mr.\nBaldwin can bear me witness.”“And in the rights of it too,” said Mr. Crabbe. “For by what I can make\nout, this Raffles, as they call him, was a lusty, fresh-colored man as\nyou’d wish to see, and the best o’ company—though dead he lies in\nLowick churchyard sure enough; and by what I can understan’, there’s\nthem knows more than they _should_ know about how he got there.”"
