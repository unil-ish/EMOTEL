  "content": "“I beg your pardon: correct English is the slang of prigs who write\nhistory and essays. And the strongest slang of all is the slang of\npoets.”“You will say anything, Fred, to gain your point.”“Well, tell me whether it is slang or poetry to call an ox a\n_leg-plaiter_.”“Of course you can call it poetry if you like.”“Aha, Miss Rosy, you don’t know Homer from slang. I shall invent a new\ngame; I shall write bits of slang and poetry on slips, and give them to\nyou to separate.”“Dear me, how amusing it is to hear young people talk!” said Mrs.\nVincy, with cheerful admiration.“Have you got nothing else for my breakfast, Pritchard?” said Fred, to\nthe servant who brought in coffee and buttered toast; while he walked\nround the table surveying the ham, potted beef, and other cold\nremnants, with an air of silent rejection, and polite forbearance from\nsigns of disgust.“Should you like eggs, sir?”“Eggs, no! Bring me a grilled bone.”“Really, Fred,” said Rosamond, when the servant had left the room, “if\nyou must have hot things for breakfast, I wish you would come down\nearlier. You can get up at six o’clock to go out hunting; I cannot\nunderstand why you find it so difficult to get up on other mornings.”“That is your want of understanding, Rosy. I can get up to go hunting\nbecause I like it.”“What would you think of me if I came down two hours after every one\nelse and ordered grilled bone?”“I should think you were an uncommonly fast young lady,” said Fred,\neating his toast with the utmost composure.“I cannot see why brothers are to make themselves disagreeable, any\nmore than sisters.”“I don’t make myself disagreeable; it is you who find me so.\nDisagreeable is a word that describes your feelings and not my\nactions.”“I think it describes the smell of grilled bone.”“Not at all. It describes a sensation in your little nose associated\nwith certain finicking notions which are the classics of Mrs. Lemon’s\nschool. Look at my mother; you don’t see her objecting to everything\nexcept what she does herself. She is my notion of a pleasant woman.”"

  "content": "“Bless you both, my dears, and don’t quarrel,” said Mrs. Vincy, with\nmotherly cordiality. “Come, Fred, tell us all about the new doctor. How\nis your uncle pleased with him?”“Pretty well, I think. He asks Lydgate all sorts of questions and then\nscrews up his face while he hears the answers, as if they were pinching\nhis toes. That’s his way. Ah, here comes my grilled bone.”“But how came you to stay out so late, my dear? You only said you were\ngoing to your uncle’s.”“Oh, I dined at Plymdale’s. We had whist. Lydgate was there too.”“And what do you think of him? He is very gentlemanly, I suppose. They\nsay he is of excellent family—his relations quite county people.”“Yes,” said Fred. “There was a Lydgate at John’s who spent no end of\nmoney. I find this man is a second cousin of his. But rich men may have\nvery poor devils for second cousins.”“It always makes a difference, though, to be of good family,” said\nRosamond, with a tone of decision which showed that she had thought on\nthis subject. Rosamond felt that she might have been happier if she had\nnot been the daughter of a Middlemarch manufacturer. She disliked\nanything which reminded her that her mother’s father had been an\ninnkeeper. Certainly any one remembering the fact might think that Mrs.\nVincy had the air of a very handsome good-humored landlady, accustomed\nto the most capricious orders of gentlemen.“I thought it was odd his name was Tertius,” said the bright-faced\nmatron, “but of course it’s a name in the family. But now, tell us\nexactly what sort of man he is.”“Oh, tallish, dark, clever—talks well—rather a prig, I think.”“I never can make out what you mean by a prig,” said Rosamond.“A fellow who wants to show that he has opinions.”“Why, my dear, doctors must have opinions,” said Mrs. Vincy. “What are\nthey there for else?”“Yes, mother, the opinions they are paid for. But a prig is a fellow\nwho is always making you a present of his opinions.”“I suppose Mary Garth admires Mr. Lydgate,” said Rosamond, not without\na touch of innuendo."

  "content": "“Really, I can’t say.” said Fred, rather glumly, as he left the table,\nand taking up a novel which he had brought down with him, threw himself\ninto an arm-chair. “If you are jealous of her, go oftener to Stone\nCourt yourself and eclipse her.”“I wish you would not be so vulgar, Fred. If you have finished, pray\nring the bell.”“It is true, though—what your brother says, Rosamond,” Mrs. Vincy\nbegan, when the servant had cleared the table. “It is a thousand pities\nyou haven’t patience to go and see your uncle more, so proud of you as\nhe is, and wanted you to live with him. There’s no knowing what he\nmight have done for you as well as for Fred. God knows, I’m fond of\nhaving you at home with me, but I can part with my children for their\ngood. And now it stands to reason that your uncle Featherstone will do\nsomething for Mary Garth.”“Mary Garth can bear being at Stone Court, because she likes that\nbetter than being a governess,” said Rosamond, folding up her work. “I\nwould rather not have anything left to me if I must earn it by enduring\nmuch of my uncle’s cough and his ugly relations.”“He can’t be long for this world, my dear; I wouldn’t hasten his end,\nbut what with asthma and that inward complaint, let us hope there is\nsomething better for him in another. And I have no ill-will towards\nMary Garth, but there’s justice to be thought of. And Mr.\nFeatherstone’s first wife brought him no money, as my sister did. Her\nnieces and nephews can’t have so much claim as my sister’s. And I must\nsay I think Mary Garth a dreadful plain girl—more fit for a governess.”“Every one would not agree with you there, mother,” said Fred, who\nseemed to be able to read and listen too.“Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy, wheeling skilfully, “if she _had_\nsome fortune left her,—a man marries his wife’s relations, and the\nGarths are so poor, and live in such a small way. But I shall leave you\nto your studies, my dear; for I must go and do some shopping.”“Fred’s studies are not very deep,” said Rosamond, rising with her\nmamma, “he is only reading a novel.”"

It’s your father’s wish, you know—Fred, my\ndear—and I always tell him you will be good, and go to college again to\ntake your degree.”Fred drew his mother’s hand down to his lips, but said nothing.“I suppose you are not going out riding to-day?” said Rosamond,\nlingering a little after her mamma was gone.“No; why?”“Papa says I may have the chestnut to ride now.”“You can go with me to-morrow, if you like. Only I am going to Stone\nCourt, remember.”“I want to ride so much, it is indifferent to me where we go.” Rosamond\nreally wished to go to Stone Court, of all other places.“Oh, I say, Rosy,” said Fred, as she was passing out of the room, “if\nyou are going to the piano, let me come and play some airs with you.”“Pray do not ask me this morning.”“Why not this morning?”“Really, Fred, I wish you would leave off playing the flute. A man\nlooks very silly playing the flute. And you play so out of tune.”“When next any one makes love to you, Miss Rosamond, I will tell him\nhow obliging you are.”“Why should you expect me to oblige you by hearing you play the flute,\nany more than I should expect you to oblige me by not playing it?”“And why should you expect me to take you out riding?”This question led to an adjustment, for Rosamond had set her mind on\nthat particular ride.So Fred was gratified with nearly an hour’s practice of “Ar hyd y nos,”\n“Ye banks and braes,” and other favorite airs from his “Instructor on\nthe Flute;” a wheezy performance, into which he threw much ambition and\nan irrepressible hopefulness.CHAPTER XII.He had more tow on his distaffe\nThan Gerveis knew.\n—CHAUCER."

  "content": "The ride to Stone Court, which Fred and Rosamond took the next morning,\nlay through a pretty bit of midland landscape, almost all meadows and\npastures, with hedgerows still allowed to grow in bushy beauty and to\nspread out coral fruit for the birds. Little details gave each field a\nparticular physiognomy, dear to the eyes that have looked on them from\nchildhood: the pool in the corner where the grasses were dank and trees\nleaned whisperingly; the great oak shadowing a bare place in\nmid-pasture; the high bank where the ash-trees grew; the sudden slope\nof the old marl-pit making a red background for the burdock; the\nhuddled roofs and ricks of the homestead without a traceable way of\napproach; the gray gate and fences against the depths of the bordering\nwood; and the stray hovel, its old, old thatch full of mossy hills and\nvalleys with wondrous modulations of light and shadow such as we travel\nfar to see in later life, and see larger, but not more beautiful. These\nare the things that make the gamut of joy in landscape to midland-bred\nsouls—the things they toddled among, or perhaps learned by heart\nstanding between their father’s knees while he drove leisurely.But the road, even the byroad, was excellent; for Lowick, as we have\nseen, was not a parish of muddy lanes and poor tenants; and it was into\nLowick parish that Fred and Rosamond entered after a couple of miles’\nriding. Another mile would bring them to Stone Court, and at the end of\nthe first half, the house was already visible, looking as if it had\nbeen arrested in its growth toward a stone mansion by an unexpected\nbudding of farm-buildings on its left flank, which had hindered it from\nbecoming anything more than the substantial dwelling of a gentleman\nfarmer. It was not the less agreeable an object in the distance for the\ncluster of pinnacled corn-ricks which balanced the fine row of walnuts\non the right.Presently it was possible to discern something that might be a gig on\nthe circular drive before the front door.“Dear me,” said Rosamond, “I hope none of my uncle’s horrible relations\nare there.”“They are, though. That is Mrs. Waule’s gig—the last yellow gig left, I\nshould think. When I see Mrs. Waule in it, I understand how yellow can\nhave been worn for mourning. That gig seems to me more funereal than a\nhearse. But then Mrs. Waule always has black crape on. How does she\nmanage it, Rosy? Her friends can’t always be dying.”“I don’t know at all. And she is not in the least evangelical,” said\nRosamond, reflectively, as if that religious point of view would have\nfully accounted for perpetual crape. “And, not poor,” she added, after\na moment’s pause.“No, by George! They are as rich as Jews, those Waules and\nFeatherstones; I mean, for people like them, who don’t want to spend\nanything. And yet they hang about my uncle like vultures, and are\nafraid of a farthing going away from their side of the family. But I\nbelieve he hates them all.”"

  "content": "The Mrs. Waule who was so far from being admirable in the eyes of these\ndistant connections, had happened to say this very morning (not at all\nwith a defiant air, but in a low, muffled, neutral tone, as of a voice\nheard through cotton wool) that she did not wish “to enjoy their good\nopinion.” She was seated, as she observed, on her own brother’s hearth,\nand had been Jane Featherstone five-and-twenty years before she had\nbeen Jane Waule, which entitled her to speak when her own brother’s\nname had been made free with by those who had no right to it.“What are you driving at there?” said Mr. Featherstone, holding his\nstick between his knees and settling his wig, while he gave her a\nmomentary sharp glance, which seemed to react on him like a draught of\ncold air and set him coughing.Mrs. Waule had to defer her answer till he was quiet again, till Mary\nGarth had supplied him with fresh syrup, and he had begun to rub the\ngold knob of his stick, looking bitterly at the fire. It was a bright\nfire, but it made no difference to the chill-looking purplish tint of\nMrs. Waule’s face, which was as neutral as her voice; having mere\nchinks for eyes, and lips that hardly moved in speaking.“The doctors can’t master that cough, brother. It’s just like what I\nhave; for I’m your own sister, constitution and everything. But, as I\nwas saying, it’s a pity Mrs. Vincy’s family can’t be better conducted.”“Tchah! you said nothing o’ the sort. You said somebody had made free\nwith my name.”“And no more than can be proved, if what everybody says is true. My\nbrother Solomon tells me it’s the talk up and down in Middlemarch how\nunsteady young Vincy is, and has been forever gambling at billiards\nsince home he came.”“Nonsense! What’s a game at billiards? It’s a good gentlemanly game;\nand young Vincy is not a clodhopper. If your son John took to\nbilliards, now, he’d make a fool of himself.”“Your nephew John never took to billiards or any other game, brother,\nand is far from losing hundreds of pounds, which, if what everybody\nsays is true, must be found somewhere else than out of Mr. Vincy the\nfather’s pocket. For they say he’s been losing money for years, though\nnobody would think so, to see him go coursing and keeping open house as\nthey do. And I’ve heard say Mr. Bulstrode condemns Mrs. Vincy beyond\nanything for her flightiness, and spoiling her children so.”“What’s Bulstrode to me? I don’t bank with him.”"

  "content": "“Well, Mrs. Bulstrode is Mr. Vincy’s own sister, and they do say that\nMr. Vincy mostly trades on the Bank money; and you may see yourself,\nbrother, when a woman past forty has pink strings always flying, and\nthat light way of laughing at everything, it’s very unbecoming. But\nindulging your children is one thing, and finding money to pay their\ndebts is another. And it’s openly said that young Vincy has raised\nmoney on his expectations. I don’t say what expectations. Miss Garth\nhears me, and is welcome to tell again. I know young people hang\ntogether.”“No, thank you, Mrs. Waule,” said Mary Garth. “I dislike hearing\nscandal too much to wish to repeat it.”Mr. Featherstone rubbed the knob of his stick and made a brief\nconvulsive show of laughter, which had much the same genuineness as an\nold whist-player’s chuckle over a bad hand. Still looking at the fire,\nhe said—“And who pretends to say Fred Vincy hasn’t got expectations? Such a\nfine, spirited fellow is like enough to have ’em.”There was a slight pause before Mrs. Waule replied, and when she did\nso, her voice seemed to be slightly moistened with tears, though her\nface was still dry.“Whether or no, brother, it is naturally painful to me and my brother\nSolomon to hear your name made free with, and your complaint being such\nas may carry you off sudden, and people who are no more Featherstones\nthan the Merry-Andrew at the fair, openly reckoning on your property\ncoming to _them_. And me your own sister, and Solomon your own brother!\nAnd if that’s to be it, what has it pleased the Almighty to make\nfamilies for?” Here Mrs. Waule’s tears fell, but with moderation.“Come, out with it, Jane!” said Mr. Featherstone, looking at her. “You\nmean to say, Fred Vincy has been getting somebody to advance him money\non what he says he knows about my will, eh?”“I never said so, brother” (Mrs. Waule’s voice had again become dry and\nunshaken). “It was told me by my brother Solomon last night when he\ncalled coming from market to give me advice about the old wheat, me\nbeing a widow, and my son John only three-and-twenty, though steady\nbeyond anything. And he had it from most undeniable authority, and not\none, but many.”“Stuff and nonsense! I don’t believe a word of it. It’s all a got-up\nstory. Go to the window, missy; I thought I heard a horse. See if the\ndoctor’s coming.”"

But Solomon makes it no secret what he means to do.”“The more fool he!” said Mr. Featherstone, with some difficulty;\nbreaking into a severe fit of coughing that required Mary Garth to\nstand near him, so that she did not find out whose horses they were\nwhich presently paused stamping on the gravel before the door.Before Mr. Featherstone’s cough was quiet, Rosamond entered, bearing up\nher riding-habit with much grace. She bowed ceremoniously to Mrs.\nWaule, who said stiffly, “How do you do, miss?” smiled and nodded\nsilently to Mary, and remained standing till the coughing should cease,\nand allow her uncle to notice her.“Heyday, miss!” he said at last, “you have a fine color. Where’s Fred?”“Seeing about the horses. He will be in presently.”“Sit down, sit down. Mrs. Waule, you’d better go.”Even those neighbors who had called Peter Featherstone an old fox, had\nnever accused him of being insincerely polite, and his sister was quite\nused to the peculiar absence of ceremony with which he marked his sense\nof blood-relationship. Indeed, she herself was accustomed to think that\nentire freedom from the necessity of behaving agreeably was included in\nthe Almighty’s intentions about families. She rose slowly without any\nsign of resentment, and said in her usual muffled monotone, “Brother, I\nhope the new doctor will be able to do something for you. Solomon says\nthere’s great talk of his cleverness. I’m sure it’s my wish you should\nbe spared. And there’s none more ready to nurse you than your own\nsister and your own nieces, if you’d only say the word. There’s\nRebecca, and Joanna, and Elizabeth, you know.”"

There never was any beauty in\nthe women of our family; but the Featherstones have always had some\nmoney, and the Waules too. Waule had money too. A warm man was Waule.\nAy, ay; money’s a good egg; and if you’ve got money to leave behind\nyou, lay it in a warm nest. Good-by, Mrs. Waule.” Here Mr. Featherstone\npulled at both sides of his wig as if he wanted to deafen himself, and\nhis sister went away ruminating on this oracular speech of his.\nNotwithstanding her jealousy of the Vincys and of Mary Garth, there\nremained as the nethermost sediment in her mental shallows a persuasion\nthat her brother Peter Featherstone could never leave his chief\nproperty away from his blood-relations:—else, why had the Almighty\ncarried off his two wives both childless, after he had gained so much\nby manganese and things, turning up when nobody expected it?—and why\nwas there a Lowick parish church, and the Waules and Powderells all\nsitting in the same pew for generations, and the Featherstone pew next\nto them, if, the Sunday after her brother Peter’s death, everybody was\nto know that the property was gone out of the family? The human mind\nhas at no period accepted a moral chaos; and so preposterous a result\nwas not strictly conceivable. But we are frightened at much that is not\nstrictly conceivable.When Fred came in the old man eyed him with a peculiar twinkle, which\nthe younger had often had reason to interpret as pride in the\nsatisfactory details of his appearance.“You two misses go away,” said Mr. Featherstone. “I want to speak to\nFred.”“Come into my room, Rosamond, you will not mind the cold for a little\nwhile,” said Mary. The two girls had not only known each other in\nchildhood, but had been at the same provincial school together (Mary as\nan articled pupil), so that they had many memories in common, and liked\nvery well to talk in private. Indeed, this _tête-à-tête_ was one of\nRosamond’s objects in coming to Stone Court.Old Featherstone would not begin the dialogue till the door had been\nclosed. He continued to look at Fred with the same twinkle and with one\nof his habitual grimaces, alternately screwing and widening his mouth;\nand when he spoke, it was in a low tone, which might be taken for that\nof an informer ready to be bought off, rather than for the tone of an\noffended senior. He was not a man to feel any strong moral indignation\neven on account of trespasses against himself. It was natural that\nothers should want to get an advantage over him, but then, he was a\nlittle too cunning for them.“So, sir, you’ve been paying ten per cent for money which you’ve\npromised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I’m dead and gone, eh?\nYou put my life at a twelvemonth, say. But I can alter my will yet.”Fred blushed. He had not borrowed money in that way, for excellent\nreasons. But he was conscious of having spoken with some confidence\n(perhaps with more than he exactly remembered) about his prospect of\ngetting Featherstone’s land as a future means of paying present debts.“I don’t know what you refer to, sir. I have certainly never borrowed\nany money on such an insecurity. Please do explain.”"

I say, you must contradict this story.”“I have contradicted it, sir,” Fred answered, with a touch of\nimpatience, not remembering that his uncle did not verbally\ndiscriminate contradicting from disproving, though no one was further\nfrom confounding the two ideas than old Featherstone, who often\nwondered that so many fools took his own assertions for proofs. “But I\ncontradict it again. The story is a silly lie.”“Nonsense! you must bring dockiments. It comes from authority.”“Name the authority, and make him name the man of whom I borrowed the\nmoney, and then I can disprove the story.”“It’s pretty good authority, I think—a man who knows most of what goes\non in Middlemarch. It’s that fine, religious, charitable uncle o’\nyours. Come now!” Here Mr. Featherstone had his peculiar inward shake\nwhich signified merriment.“Mr. Bulstrode?”“Who else, eh?”“Then the story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing words\nhe may have let fall about me. Do they pretend that he named the man\nwho lent me the money?”“If there is such a man, depend upon it Bulstrode knows him. But,\nsupposing you only tried to get the money lent, and didn’t get\nit—Bulstrode ’ud know that too. You bring me a writing from Bulstrode\nto say he doesn’t believe you’ve ever promised to pay your debts out o’\nmy land. Come now!”Mr. Featherstone’s face required its whole scale of grimaces as a\nmuscular outlet to his silent triumph in the soundness of his\nfaculties.Fred felt himself to be in a disgusting dilemma.“You must be joking, sir. Mr. Bulstrode, like other men, believes\nscores of things that are not true, and he has a prejudice against me.\nI could easily get him to write that he knew no facts in proof of the\nreport you speak of, though it might lead to unpleasantness. But I\ncould hardly ask him to write down what he believes or does not believe\nabout me.” Fred paused an instant, and then added, in politic appeal to\nhis uncle’s vanity, “That is hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask.”\nBut he was disappointed in the result."

There’s one thing I made out\npretty clear when I used to go to church—and it’s this: God A’mighty\nsticks to the land. He promises land, and He gives land, and He makes\nchaps rich with corn and cattle. But you take the other side. You like\nBulstrode and speckilation better than Featherstone and land.”“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Fred, rising, standing with his back to\nthe fire and beating his boot with his whip. “I like neither Bulstrode\nnor speculation.” He spoke rather sulkily, feeling himself stalemated.“Well, well, you can do without me, that’s pretty clear,” said old\nFeatherstone, secretly disliking the possibility that Fred would show\nhimself at all independent. “You neither want a bit of land to make a\nsquire of you instead of a starving parson, nor a lift of a hundred\npound by the way. It’s all one to me. I can make five codicils if I\nlike, and I shall keep my bank-notes for a nest-egg. It’s all one to\nme.”Fred colored again. Featherstone had rarely given him presents of\nmoney, and at this moment it seemed almost harder to part with the\nimmediate prospect of bank-notes than with the more distant prospect of\nthe land.“I am not ungrateful, sir. I never meant to show disregard for any kind\nintentions you might have towards me. On the contrary.”“Very good. Then prove it. You bring me a letter from Bulstrode saying\nhe doesn’t believe you’ve been cracking and promising to pay your debts\nout o’ my land, and then, if there’s any scrape you’ve got into, we’ll\nsee if I can’t back you a bit. Come now! That’s a bargain. Here, give\nme your arm. I’ll try and walk round the room.”Fred, in spite of his irritation, had kindness enough in him to be a\nlittle sorry for the unloved, unvenerated old man, who with his\ndropsical legs looked more than usually pitiable in walking. While\ngiving his arm, he thought that he should not himself like to be an old\nfellow with his constitution breaking up; and he waited\ngood-temperedly, first before the window to hear the wonted remarks\nabout the guinea-fowls and the weather-cock, and then before the scanty\nbook-shelves, of which the chief glories in dark calf were Josephus,\nCulpepper, Klopstock’s “Messiah,” and several volumes of the\n“Gentleman’s Magazine.”“Read me the names o’ the books.

They\ndid not think of sitting down, but stood at the toilet-table near the\nwindow while Rosamond took off her hat, adjusted her veil, and applied\nlittle touches of her finger-tips to her hair—hair of infantine\nfairness, neither flaxen nor yellow. Mary Garth seemed all the plainer\nstanding at an angle between the two nymphs—the one in the glass, and\nthe one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of heavenly blue,\ndeep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder\ncould put into them, and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner\nif these should happen to be less exquisite. Only a few children in\nMiddlemarch looked blond by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure\ndisplayed by her riding-habit had delicate undulations. In fact, most\nmen in Middlemarch, except her brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the\nbest girl in the world, and some called her an angel. Mary Garth, on\nthe contrary, had the aspect of an ordinary sinner: she was brown; her\ncurly dark hair was rough and stubborn; her stature was low; and it\nwould not be true to declare, in satisfactory antithesis, that she had\nall the virtues. Plainness has its peculiar temptations and vices quite\nas much as beauty; it is apt either to feign amiability, or, not\nfeigning it, to show all the repulsiveness of discontent: at any rate,\nto be called an ugly thing in contrast with that lovely creature your\ncompanion, is apt to produce some effect beyond a sense of fine\nveracity and fitness in the phrase. At the age of two-and-twenty Mary\nhad certainly not attained that perfect good sense and good principle\nwhich are usually recommended to the less fortunate girl, as if they\nwere to be obtained in quantities ready mixed, with a flavor of\nresignation as required. Her shrewdness had a streak of satiric\nbitterness continually renewed and never carried utterly out of sight,\nexcept by a strong current of gratitude towards those who, instead of\ntelling her that she ought to be contented, did something to make her\nso. Advancing womanhood had tempered her plainness, which was of a good\nhuman sort, such as the mothers of our race have very commonly worn in\nall latitudes under a more or less becoming headgear. Rembrandt would\nhave painted her with pleasure, and would have made her broad features\nlook out of the canvas with intelligent honesty. For honesty,\ntruth-telling fairness, was Mary’s reigning virtue: she neither tried\nto create illusions, nor indulged in them for her own behoof, and when\nshe was in a good mood she had humor enough in her to laugh at herself.\nWhen she and Rosamond happened both to be reflected in the glass, she\nsaid, laughingly—"

Beauty is of very little consequence in reality,” said\nRosamond, turning her head towards Mary, but with eyes swerving towards\nthe new view of her neck in the glass.“You mean _my_ beauty,” said Mary, rather sardonically.Rosamond thought, “Poor Mary, she takes the kindest things ill.” Aloud\nshe said, “What have you been doing lately?”“I? Oh, minding the house—pouring out syrup—pretending to be amiable\nand contented—learning to have a bad opinion of everybody.”“It is a wretched life for you.”“No,” said Mary, curtly, with a little toss of her head. “I think my\nlife is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan’s.”“Yes; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young.”“She is interesting to herself, I suppose; and I am not at all sure\nthat everything gets easier as one gets older.”“No,” said Rosamond, reflectively; “one wonders what such people do,\nwithout any prospect. To be sure, there is religion as a support. But,”\nshe added, dimpling, “it is very different with you, Mary. You may have\nan offer.”“Has any one told you he means to make me one?”“Of course not. I mean, there is a gentleman who may fall in love with\nyou, seeing you almost every day.”A certain change in Mary’s face was chiefly determined by the resolve\nnot to show any change.“Does that always make people fall in love?” she answered, carelessly;\n“it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting each other.”“Not when they are interesting and agreeable. I hear that Mr. Lydgate\nis both.”“Oh, Mr. Lydgate!” said Mary, with an unmistakable lapse into\nindifference. “You want to know something about him,” she added, not\nchoosing to indulge Rosamond’s indirectness.“Merely, how you like him.”"

I am not magnanimous enough to like\npeople who speak to me without seeming to see me.”“Is he so haughty?” said Rosamond, with heightened satisfaction. “You\nknow that he is of good family?”“No; he did not give that as a reason.”“Mary! you are the oddest girl. But what sort of looking man is he?\nDescribe him to me.”“How can one describe a man? I can give you an inventory: heavy\neyebrows, dark eyes, a straight nose, thick dark hair, large solid\nwhite hands—and—let me see—oh, an exquisite cambric\npocket-handkerchief. But you will see him. You know this is about the\ntime of his visits.”Rosamond blushed a little, but said, meditatively, “I rather like a\nhaughty manner. I cannot endure a rattling young man.”“I did not tell you that Mr. Lydgate was haughty; but _il y en a pour\ntous les goûts_, as little Mamselle used to say, and if any girl can\nchoose the particular sort of conceit she would like, I should think it\nis you, Rosy.”“Haughtiness is not conceit; I call Fred conceited.”“I wish no one said any worse of him. He should be more careful. Mrs.\nWaule has been telling uncle that Fred is very unsteady.” Mary spoke\nfrom a girlish impulse which got the better of her judgment. There was\na vague uneasiness associated with the word “unsteady” which she hoped\nRosamond might say something to dissipate. But she purposely abstained\nfrom mentioning Mrs. Waule’s more special insinuation.“Oh, Fred is horrid!” said Rosamond. She would not have allowed herself\nso unsuitable a word to any one but Mary.“What do you mean by horrid?”“He is so idle, and makes papa so angry, and says he will not take\norders.”“I think Fred is quite right.”“How can you say he is quite right, Mary? I thought you had more sense\nof religion.”“He is not fit to be a clergyman.”“But he ought to be fit.”—“Well, then, he is not what he ought to be. I\nknow some other people who are in the same case.”“But no one approves of them. I should not like to marry a clergyman;\nbut there must be clergymen.”“It does not follow that Fred must be one.”"

And\nonly suppose, if he should have no fortune left him?”“I can suppose that very well,” said Mary, dryly.“Then I wonder you can defend Fred,” said Rosamond, inclined to push\nthis point.“I don’t defend him,” said Mary, laughing; “I would defend any parish\nfrom having him for a clergyman.”“But of course if he were a clergyman, he must be different.”“Yes, he would be a great hypocrite; and he is not that yet.”“It is of no use saying anything to you, Mary. You always take Fred’s\npart.”“Why should I not take his part?” said Mary, lighting up. “He would\ntake mine. He is the only person who takes the least trouble to oblige\nme.”“You make me feel very uncomfortable, Mary,” said Rosamond, with her\ngravest mildness; “I would not tell mamma for the world.”“What would you not tell her?” said Mary, angrily.“Pray do not go into a rage, Mary,” said Rosamond, mildly as ever.“If your mamma is afraid that Fred will make me an offer, tell her that\nI would not marry him if he asked me. But he is not going to do so,\nthat I am aware. He certainly never has asked me.”“Mary, you are always so violent.”“And you are always so exasperating.”“I? What can you blame me for?”“Oh, blameless people are always the most exasperating. There is the\nbell—I think we must go down.”“I did not mean to quarrel,” said Rosamond, putting on her hat.“Quarrel? Nonsense; we have not quarrelled. If one is not to get into a\nrage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?”“Am I to repeat what you have said?”“Just as you please. I never say what I am afraid of having repeated.\nBut let us go down.”Mr. Lydgate was rather late this morning, but the visitors stayed long\nenough to see him; for Mr. Featherstone asked Rosamond to sing to him,\nand she herself was so kind as to propose a second favorite song of\nhis—“Flow on, thou shining river”—after she had sung “Home, sweet home”\n(which she detested). This hard-headed old Overreach approved of the\nsentimental song, as the suitable garnish for girls, and also as\nfundamentally fine, sentiment being the right thing for a song."

  "content": "Mr. Featherstone was still applauding the last performance, and\nassuring missy that her voice was as clear as a blackbird’s, when Mr.\nLydgate’s horse passed the window.His dull expectation of the usual disagreeable routine with an aged\npatient—who can hardly believe that medicine would not “set him up” if\nthe doctor were only clever enough—added to his general disbelief in\nMiddlemarch charms, made a doubly effective background to this vision\nof Rosamond, whom old Featherstone made haste ostentatiously to\nintroduce as his niece, though he had never thought it worth while to\nspeak of Mary Garth in that light. Nothing escaped Lydgate in\nRosamond’s graceful behavior: how delicately she waived the notice\nwhich the old man’s want of taste had thrust upon her by a quiet\ngravity, not showing her dimples on the wrong occasion, but showing\nthem afterwards in speaking to Mary, to whom she addressed herself with\nso much good-natured interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining\nMary more fully than he had done before, saw an adorable kindness in\nRosamond’s eyes. But Mary from some cause looked rather out of temper.“Miss Rosy has been singing me a song—you’ve nothing to say against\nthat, eh, doctor?” said Mr. Featherstone. “I like it better than your\nphysic.”“That has made me forget how the time was going,” said Rosamond, rising\nto reach her hat, which she had laid aside before singing, so that her\nflower-like head on its white stem was seen in perfection above her\nriding-habit. “Fred, we must really go.”“Very good,” said Fred, who had his own reasons for not being in the\nbest spirits, and wanted to get away.“Miss Vincy is a musician?” said Lydgate, following her with his eyes.\n(Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness\nthat she was being looked at. She was by nature an actress of parts\nthat entered into her _physique:_ she even acted her own character, and\nso well, that she did not know it to be precisely her own.)“The best in Middlemarch, I’ll be bound,” said Mr. Featherstone, “let\nthe next be who she will.

He reached the whip before she\ndid, and turned to present it to her. She bowed and looked at him: he\nof course was looking at her, and their eyes met with that peculiar\nmeeting which is never arrived at by effort, but seems like a sudden\ndivine clearance of haze. I think Lydgate turned a little paler than\nusual, but Rosamond blushed deeply and felt a certain astonishment.\nAfter that, she was really anxious to go, and did not know what sort of\nstupidity her uncle was talking of when she went to shake hands with\nhim."

  "content": "Yet this result, which she took to be a mutual impression, called\nfalling in love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand.\nEver since that important new arrival in Middlemarch she had woven a\nlittle future, of which something like this scene was the necessary\nbeginning. Strangers, whether wrecked and clinging to a raft, or duly\nescorted and accompanied by portmanteaus, have always had a\ncircumstantial fascination for the virgin mind, against which native\nmerit has urged itself in vain. And a stranger was absolutely necessary\nto Rosamond’s social romance, which had always turned on a lover and\nbridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at\nall like her own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand\nthat he should somehow be related to a baronet. Now that she and the\nstranger had met, reality proved much more moving than anticipation,\nand Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great epoch of her life.\nShe judged of her own symptoms as those of awakening love, and she held\nit still more natural that Mr. Lydgate should have fallen in love at\nfirst sight of her. These things happened so often at balls, and why\nnot by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for\nit? Rosamond, though no older than Mary, was rather used to being\nfallen in love with; but she, for her part, had remained indifferent\nand fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor.\nAnd here was Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to her ideal, being\naltogether foreign to Middlemarch, carrying a certain air of\ndistinction congruous with good family, and possessing connections\nwhich offered vistas of that middle-class heaven, rank; a man of\ntalent, also, whom it would be especially delightful to enslave: in\nfact, a man who had touched her nature quite newly, and brought a vivid\ninterest into her life which was better than any fancied “might-be”\nsuch as she was in the habit of opposing to the actual.Thus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were preoccupied\nand inclined to be silent. Rosamond, whose basis for her structure had\nthe usual airy slightness, was of remarkably detailed and realistic\nimagination when the foundation had been once presupposed; and before\nthey had ridden a mile she was far on in the costume and introductions\nof her wedded life, having determined on her house in Middlemarch, and\nforeseen the visits she would pay to her husband’s high-bred relatives\nat a distance, whose finished manners she could appropriate as\nthoroughly as she had done her school accomplishments, preparing\nherself thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come. There\nwas nothing financial, still less sordid, in her previsions: she cared\nabout what were considered refinements, and not about the money that\nwas to pay for them."

  "content": "Fred’s mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his\nready hopefulness could not immediately quell. He saw no way of eluding\nFeatherstone’s stupid demand without incurring consequences which he\nliked less even than the task of fulfilling it. His father was already\nout of humor with him, and would be still more so if he were the\noccasion of any additional coolness between his own family and the\nBulstrodes. Then, he himself hated having to go and speak to his uncle\nBulstrode, and perhaps after drinking wine he had said many foolish\nthings about Featherstone’s property, and these had been magnified by\nreport. Fred felt that he made a wretched figure as a fellow who\nbragged about expectations from a queer old miser like Featherstone,\nand went to beg for certificates at his bidding. But—those\nexpectations! He really had them, and he saw no agreeable alternative\nif he gave them up; besides, he had lately made a debt which galled him\nextremely, and old Featherstone had almost bargained to pay it off. The\nwhole affair was miserably small: his debts were small, even his\nexpectations were not anything so very magnificent. Fred had known men\nto whom he would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness of his\nscrapes. Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of misanthropic\nbitterness. To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and\ninevitable heir to nothing in particular, while such men as Mainwaring\nand Vyan—certainly life was a poor business, when a spirited young\nfellow, with a good appetite for the best of everything, had so poor an\noutlook.It had not occurred to Fred that the introduction of Bulstrode’s name\nin the matter was a fiction of old Featherstone’s; nor could this have\nmade any difference to his position. He saw plainly enough that the old\nman wanted to exercise his power by tormenting him a little, and also\nprobably to get some satisfaction out of seeing him on unpleasant terms\nwith Bulstrode. Fred fancied that he saw to the bottom of his uncle\nFeatherstone’s soul, though in reality half what he saw there was no\nmore than the reflex of his own inclinations. The difficult task of\nknowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is\nchiefly made up of their own wishes.Fred’s main point of debate with himself was, whether he should tell\nhis father, or try to get through the affair without his father’s\nknowledge. It was probably Mrs. Waule who had been talking about him;\nand if Mary Garth had repeated Mrs. Waule’s report to Rosamond, it\nwould be sure to reach his father, who would as surely question him\nabout it. He said to Rosamond, as they slackened their pace—“Rosy, did Mary tell you that Mrs. Waule had said anything about me?”“Yes, indeed, she did.”“What?”“That you were very unsteady.”“Was that all?”“I should think that was enough, Fred.”“You are sure she said no more?”“Mary mentioned nothing else. But really, Fred, I think you ought to be\nashamed.”“Oh, fudge! Don’t lecture me. What did Mary say about it?”“I am not obliged to tell you. You care so very much what Mary says,\nand you are too rude to allow me to speak.”“Of course I care what Mary says. She is the best girl I know.”“I should never have thought she was a girl to fall in love with.”“How do you know what men would fall in love with? Girls never know.”“At least, Fred, let me advise _you_ not to fall in love with her, for\nshe says she would not marry you if you asked her.”“She might have waited till I did ask her.”“I knew it would nettle you, Fred.”"

  "content": "In consequence of what he had heard from Fred, Mr. Vincy determined to\nspeak with Mr. Bulstrode in his private room at the Bank at half-past\none, when he was usually free from other callers. But a visitor had\ncome in at one o’clock, and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him,\nthat there was little chance of the interview being over in half an\nhour. The banker’s speech was fluent, but it was also copious, and he\nused up an appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pauses. Do\nnot imagine his sickly aspect to have been of the yellow, black-haired\nsort: he had a pale blond skin, thin gray-besprinkled brown hair,\nlight-gray eyes, and a large forehead. Loud men called his subdued tone\nan undertone, and sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with\nopenness; though there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not\nbe given to concealment of anything except his own voice, unless it can\nbe shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs. Mr.\nBulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening, and an\napparently fixed attentiveness in his eyes which made those persons who\nthought themselves worth hearing infer that he was seeking the utmost\nimprovement from their discourse. Others, who expected to make no great\nfigure, disliked this kind of moral lantern turned on them. If you are\nnot proud of your cellar, there is no thrill of satisfaction in seeing\nyour guest hold up his wine-glass to the light and look judicial. Such\njoys are reserved for conscious merit. Hence Mr. Bulstrode’s close\nattention was not agreeable to the publicans and sinners in\nMiddlemarch; it was attributed by some to his being a Pharisee, and by\nothers to his being Evangelical. Less superficial reasoners among them\nwished to know who his father and grandfather were, observing that\nfive-and-twenty years ago nobody had ever heard of a Bulstrode in\nMiddlemarch. To his present visitor, Lydgate, the scrutinizing look was\na matter of indifference: he simply formed an unfavorable opinion of\nthe banker’s constitution, and concluded that he had an eager inward\nlife with little enjoyment of tangible things."

  "content": "“I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will look in on me here\noccasionally, Mr. Lydgate,” the banker observed, after a brief pause.\n“If, as I dare to hope, I have the privilege of finding you a valuable\ncoadjutor in the interesting matter of hospital management, there will\nbe many questions which we shall need to discuss in private. As to the\nnew hospital, which is nearly finished, I shall consider what you have\nsaid about the advantages of the special destination for fevers. The\ndecision will rest with me, for though Lord Medlicote has given the\nland and timber for the building, he is not disposed to give his\npersonal attention to the object.”“There are few things better worth the pains in a provincial town like\nthis,” said Lydgate. “A fine fever hospital in addition to the old\ninfirmary might be the nucleus of a medical school here, when once we\nget our medical reforms; and what would do more for medical education\nthan the spread of such schools over the country? A born provincial man\nwho has a grain of public spirit as well as a few ideas, should do what\nhe can to resist the rush of everything that is a little better than\ncommon towards London. Any valid professional aims may often find a\nfreer, if not a richer field, in the provinces.”One of Lydgate’s gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet\ncapable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment. About his\nordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of\nsuccess, a confidence in his own powers and integrity much fortified by\ncontempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no\nexperience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression\nof unaffected good-will. Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him the better for\nthe difference between them in pitch and manners; he certainly liked\nhim the better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in Middlemarch.\nOne can begin so many things with a new person!—even begin to be a\nbetter man."
