  "content": "In consequence of what he had heard from Fred, Mr. Vincy determined to\nspeak with Mr. Bulstrode in his private room at the Bank at half-past\none, when he was usually free from other callers. But a visitor had\ncome in at one o’clock, and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him,\nthat there was little chance of the interview being over in half an\nhour. The banker’s speech was fluent, but it was also copious, and he\nused up an appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pauses. Do\nnot imagine his sickly aspect to have been of the yellow, black-haired\nsort: he had a pale blond skin, thin gray-besprinkled brown hair,\nlight-gray eyes, and a large forehead. Loud men called his subdued tone\nan undertone, and sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with\nopenness; though there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not\nbe given to concealment of anything except his own voice, unless it can\nbe shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs. Mr.\nBulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening, and an\napparently fixed attentiveness in his eyes which made those persons who\nthought themselves worth hearing infer that he was seeking the utmost\nimprovement from their discourse. Others, who expected to make no great\nfigure, disliked this kind of moral lantern turned on them. If you are\nnot proud of your cellar, there is no thrill of satisfaction in seeing\nyour guest hold up his wine-glass to the light and look judicial. Such\njoys are reserved for conscious merit. Hence Mr. Bulstrode’s close\nattention was not agreeable to the publicans and sinners in\nMiddlemarch; it was attributed by some to his being a Pharisee, and by\nothers to his being Evangelical. Less superficial reasoners among them\nwished to know who his father and grandfather were, observing that\nfive-and-twenty years ago nobody had ever heard of a Bulstrode in\nMiddlemarch. To his present visitor, Lydgate, the scrutinizing look was\na matter of indifference: he simply formed an unfavorable opinion of\nthe banker’s constitution, and concluded that he had an eager inward\nlife with little enjoyment of tangible things."

  "content": "“I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will look in on me here\noccasionally, Mr. Lydgate,” the banker observed, after a brief pause.\n“If, as I dare to hope, I have the privilege of finding you a valuable\ncoadjutor in the interesting matter of hospital management, there will\nbe many questions which we shall need to discuss in private. As to the\nnew hospital, which is nearly finished, I shall consider what you have\nsaid about the advantages of the special destination for fevers. The\ndecision will rest with me, for though Lord Medlicote has given the\nland and timber for the building, he is not disposed to give his\npersonal attention to the object.”“There are few things better worth the pains in a provincial town like\nthis,” said Lydgate. “A fine fever hospital in addition to the old\ninfirmary might be the nucleus of a medical school here, when once we\nget our medical reforms; and what would do more for medical education\nthan the spread of such schools over the country? A born provincial man\nwho has a grain of public spirit as well as a few ideas, should do what\nhe can to resist the rush of everything that is a little better than\ncommon towards London. Any valid professional aims may often find a\nfreer, if not a richer field, in the provinces.”One of Lydgate’s gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet\ncapable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment. About his\nordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of\nsuccess, a confidence in his own powers and integrity much fortified by\ncontempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he had had no\nexperience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression\nof unaffected good-will. Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him the better for\nthe difference between them in pitch and manners; he certainly liked\nhim the better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in Middlemarch.\nOne can begin so many things with a new person!—even begin to be a\nbetter man."

  "content": "“I shall rejoice to furnish your zeal with fuller opportunities,” Mr.\nBulstrode answered; “I mean, by confiding to you the superintendence of\nmy new hospital, should a maturer knowledge favor that issue, for I am\ndetermined that so great an object shall not be shackled by our two\nphysicians. Indeed, I am encouraged to consider your advent to this\ntown as a gracious indication that a more manifest blessing is now to\nbe awarded to my efforts, which have hitherto been much withstood. With\nregard to the old infirmary, we have gained the initial point—I mean\nyour election. And now I hope you will not shrink from incurring a\ncertain amount of jealousy and dislike from your professional brethren\nby presenting yourself as a reformer.”“I will not profess bravery,” said Lydgate, smiling, “but I acknowledge\na good deal of pleasure in fighting, and I should not care for my\nprofession, if I did not believe that better methods were to be found\nand enforced there as well as everywhere else.”“The standard of that profession is low in Middlemarch, my dear sir,”\nsaid the banker. “I mean in knowledge and skill; not in social status,\nfor our medical men are most of them connected with respectable\ntownspeople here. My own imperfect health has induced me to give some\nattention to those palliative resources which the divine mercy has\nplaced within our reach. I have consulted eminent men in the\nmetropolis, and I am painfully aware of the backwardness under which\nmedical treatment labors in our provincial districts.”“Yes;—with our present medical rules and education, one must be\nsatisfied now and then to meet with a fair practitioner. As to all the\nhigher questions which determine the starting-point of a diagnosis—as\nto the philosophy of medical evidence—any glimmering of these can only\ncome from a scientific culture of which country practitioners have\nusually no more notion than the man in the moon.”Mr. Bulstrode, bending and looking intently, found the form which\nLydgate had given to his agreement not quite suited to his\ncomprehension. Under such circumstances a judicious man changes the\ntopic and enters on ground where his own gifts may be more useful.“I am aware,” he said, “that the peculiar bias of medical ability is\ntowards material means. Nevertheless, Mr. Lydgate, I hope we shall not\nvary in sentiment as to a measure in which you are not likely to be\nactively concerned, but in which your sympathetic concurrence may be an\naid to me. You recognize, I hope; the existence of spiritual interests\nin your patients?”“Certainly I do. But those words are apt to cover different meanings to\ndifferent minds.”"

  "content": "“Precisely. And on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as no\nteaching. Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a new\nregulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary. The building\nstands in Mr. Farebrother’s parish. You know Mr. Farebrother?”“I have seen him. He gave me his vote. I must call to thank him. He\nseems a very bright pleasant little fellow. And I understand he is a\nnaturalist.”“Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, is a man deeply painful to contemplate.\nI suppose there is not a clergyman in this country who has greater\ntalents.” Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative.“I have not yet been pained by finding any excessive talent in\nMiddlemarch,” said Lydgate, bluntly.“What I desire,” Mr. Bulstrode continued, looking still more serious,\n“is that Mr. Farebrother’s attendance at the hospital should be\nsuperseded by the appointment of a chaplain—of Mr. Tyke, in fact—and\nthat no other spiritual aid should be called in.”“As a medical man I could have no opinion on such a point unless I knew\nMr. Tyke, and even then I should require to know the cases in which he\nwas applied.” Lydgate smiled, but he was bent on being circumspect.“Of course you cannot enter fully into the merits of this measure at\npresent. But”—here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a more chiselled\nemphasis—“the subject is likely to be referred to the medical board of\nthe infirmary, and what I trust I may ask of you is, that in virtue of\nthe cooperation between us which I now look forward to, you will not,\nso far as you are concerned, be influenced by my opponents in this\nmatter.”“I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes,” said\nLydgate. “The path I have chosen is to work well in my own profession.”"

  "content": "“My responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, is of a broader kind. With me, indeed,\nthis question is one of sacred accountableness; whereas with my\nopponents, I have good reason to say that it is an occasion for\ngratifying a spirit of worldly opposition. But I shall not therefore\ndrop one iota of my convictions, or cease to identify myself with that\ntruth which an evil generation hates. I have devoted myself to this\nobject of hospital-improvement, but I will boldly confess to you, Mr.\nLydgate, that I should have no interest in hospitals if I believed that\nnothing more was concerned therein than the cure of mortal diseases. I\nhave another ground of action, and in the face of persecution I will\nnot conceal it.”Mr. Bulstrode’s voice had become a loud and agitated whisper as he said\nthe last words.“There we certainly differ,” said Lydgate. But he was not sorry that\nthe door was now opened, and Mr. Vincy was announced. That florid\nsociable personage was become more interesting to him since he had seen\nRosamond. Not that, like her, he had been weaving any future in which\ntheir lots were united; but a man naturally remembers a charming girl\nwith pleasure, and is willing to dine where he may see her again.\nBefore he took leave, Mr. Vincy had given that invitation which he had\nbeen “in no hurry about,” for Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that\nshe thought her uncle Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great\nfavor.Mr. Bulstrode, alone with his brother-in-law, poured himself out a\nglass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.“I cannot persuade you to adopt my regimen, Vincy?”“No, no; I’ve no opinion of that system. Life wants padding,” said Mr.\nVincy, unable to omit his portable theory. “However,” he went on,\naccenting the word, as if to dismiss all irrelevance, “what I came here\nto talk about was a little affair of my young scapegrace, Fred’s.”“That is a subject on which you and I are likely to take quite as\ndifferent views as on diet, Vincy.”“I hope not this time.” (Mr. Vincy was resolved to be good-humored.)\n“The fact is, it’s about a whim of old Featherstone’s. Somebody has\nbeen cooking up a story out of spite, and telling it to the old man, to\ntry to set him against Fred. He’s very fond of Fred, and is likely to\ndo something handsome for him; indeed he has as good as told Fred that\nhe means to leave him his land, and that makes other people jealous.”"

  "content": "“Vincy, I must repeat, that you will not get any concurrence from me as\nto the course you have pursued with your eldest son. It was entirely\nfrom worldly vanity that you destined him for the Church: with a family\nof three sons and four daughters, you were not warranted in devoting\nmoney to an expensive education which has succeeded in nothing but in\ngiving him extravagant idle habits. You are now reaping the\nconsequences.”To point out other people’s errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode rarely\nshrank from, but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be patient. When\na man has the immediate prospect of being mayor, and is ready, in the\ninterests of commerce, to take up a firm attitude on politics\ngenerally, he has naturally a sense of his importance to the framework\nof things which seems to throw questions of private conduct into the\nbackground. And this particular reproof irritated him more than any\nother. It was eminently superfluous to him to be told that he was\nreaping the consequences. But he felt his neck under Bulstrode’s yoke;\nand though he usually enjoyed kicking, he was anxious to refrain from\nthat relief.“As to that, Bulstrode, it’s no use going back. I’m not one of your\npattern men, and I don’t pretend to be. I couldn’t foresee everything\nin the trade; there wasn’t a finer business in Middlemarch than ours,\nand the lad was clever. My poor brother was in the Church, and would\nhave done well—had got preferment already, but that stomach fever took\nhim off: else he might have been a dean by this time. I think I was\njustified in what I tried to do for Fred. If you come to religion, it\nseems to me a man shouldn’t want to carve out his meat to an ounce\nbeforehand:—one must trust a little to Providence and be generous. It’s\na good British feeling to try and raise your family a little: in my\nopinion, it’s a father’s duty to give his sons a fine chance.”“I don’t wish to act otherwise than as your best friend, Vincy, when I\nsay that what you have been uttering just now is one mass of\nworldliness and inconsistent folly.”“Very well,” said Mr. Vincy, kicking in spite of resolutions, “I never\nprofessed to be anything but worldly; and, what’s more, I don’t see\nanybody else who is not worldly. I suppose you don’t conduct business\non what you call unworldly principles. The only difference I see is\nthat one worldliness is a little bit honester than another.”"

  "content": "“This kind of discussion is unfruitful, Vincy,” said Mr. Bulstrode,\nwho, finishing his sandwich, had thrown himself back in his chair, and\nshaded his eyes as if weary. “You had some more particular business.”“Yes, yes. The long and short of it is, somebody has told old\nFeatherstone, giving you as the authority, that Fred has been borrowing\nor trying to borrow money on the prospect of his land. Of course you\nnever said any such nonsense. But the old fellow will insist on it that\nFred should bring him a denial in your handwriting; that is, just a bit\nof a note saying you don’t believe a word of such stuff, either of his\nhaving borrowed or tried to borrow in such a fool’s way. I suppose you\ncan have no objection to do that.”“Pardon me. I have an objection. I am by no means sure that your son,\nin his recklessness and ignorance—I will use no severer word—has not\ntried to raise money by holding out his future prospects, or even that\nsome one may not have been foolish enough to supply him on so vague a\npresumption: there is plenty of such lax money-lending as of other\nfolly in the world.”“But Fred gives me his honor that he has never borrowed money on the\npretence of any understanding about his uncle’s land. He is not a liar.\nI don’t want to make him better than he is. I have blown him up\nwell—nobody can say I wink at what he does. But he is not a liar. And I\nshould have thought—but I may be wrong—that there was no religion to\nhinder a man from believing the best of a young fellow, when you don’t\nknow worse. It seems to me it would be a poor sort of religion to put a\nspoke in his wheel by refusing to say you don’t believe such harm of\nhim as you’ve got no good reason to believe.”"

You do not like to hear these things, Vincy,\nbut on this occasion I feel called upon to tell you that I have no\nmotive for furthering such a disposition of property as that which you\nrefer to. I do not shrink from saying that it will not tend to your\nson’s eternal welfare or to the glory of God. Why then should you\nexpect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to\nkeep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?”“If you mean to hinder everybody from having money but saints and\nevangelists, you must give up some profitable partnerships, that’s all\nI can say,” Mr. Vincy burst out very bluntly. “It may be for the glory\nof God, but it is not for the glory of the Middlemarch trade, that\nPlymdale’s house uses those blue and green dyes it gets from the\nBrassing manufactory; they rot the silk, that’s all I know about it.\nPerhaps if other people knew so much of the profit went to the glory of\nGod, they might like it better. But I don’t mind so much about that—I\ncould get up a pretty row, if I chose.”Mr. Bulstrode paused a little before he answered. “You pain me very\nmuch by speaking in this way, Vincy. I do not expect you to understand\nmy grounds of action—it is not an easy thing even to thread a path for\nprinciples in the intricacies of the world—still less to make the\nthread clear for the careless and the scoffing. You must remember, if\nyou please, that I stretch my tolerance towards you as my wife’s\nbrother, and that it little becomes you to complain of me as\nwithholding material help towards the worldly position of your family.\nI must remind you that it is not your own prudence or judgment that has\nenabled you to keep your place in the trade.”“Very likely not; but you have been no loser by my trade yet,” said Mr.\nVincy, thoroughly nettled (a result which was seldom much retarded by\nprevious resolutions). “And when you married Harriet, I don’t see how\nyou could expect that our families should not hang by the same nail. If\nyou’ve changed your mind, and want my family to come down in the world,\nyou’d better say so. I’ve never changed; I’m a plain Churchman now,\njust as I used to be before doctrines came up. I take the world as I\nfind it, in trade and everything else. I’m contented to be no worse\nthan my neighbors. But if you want us to come down in the world, say\nso.

You might as well slander Fred: it comes\npretty near to it when you refuse to say you didn’t set a slander\ngoing. It’s this sort of thing—this tyrannical spirit, wanting to play\nbishop and banker everywhere—it’s this sort of thing makes a man’s name\nstink.”“Vincy, if you insist on quarrelling with me, it will be exceedingly\npainful to Harriet as well as myself,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with a\ntrifle more eagerness and paleness than usual.“I don’t want to quarrel. It’s for my interest—and perhaps for yours\ntoo—that we should be friends. I bear you no grudge; I think no worse\nof you than I do of other people. A man who half starves himself, and\ngoes the length in family prayers, and so on, that you do, believes in\nhis religion whatever it may be: you could turn over your capital just\nas fast with cursing and swearing:—plenty of fellows do.

  "content": "This was not the first time that Mr. Bulstrode had begun by admonishing\nMr. Vincy, and had ended by seeing a very unsatisfactory reflection of\nhimself in the coarse unflattering mirror which that manufacturer’s\nmind presented to the subtler lights and shadows of his fellow-men; and\nperhaps his experience ought to have warned him how the scene would\nend. But a full-fed fountain will be generous with its waters even in\nthe rain, when they are worse than useless; and a fine fount of\nadmonition is apt to be equally irrepressible.It was not in Mr. Bulstrode’s nature to comply directly in consequence\nof uncomfortable suggestions. Before changing his course, he always\nneeded to shape his motives and bring them into accordance with his\nhabitual standard. He said, at last—“I will reflect a little, Vincy. I will mention the subject to Harriet.\nI shall probably send you a letter.”“Very well. As soon as you can, please. I hope it will all be settled\nbefore I see you to-morrow.”CHAPTER XIV.“Follows here the strict receipt\nFor that sauce to dainty meat,\nNamed Idleness, which many eat\nBy preference, and call it sweet:\n_First watch for morsels, like a hound\nMix well with buffets, stir them round\nWith good thick oil of flatteries, And froth with mean self-lauding\nlies.\nServe warm: the vessels you must choose\nTo keep it in are dead men’s shoes._”Mr. Bulstrode’s consultation of Harriet seemed to have had the effect\ndesired by Mr. Vincy, for early the next morning a letter came which\nFred could carry to Mr. Featherstone as the required testimony.The old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather,\nand as Mary Garth was not to be seen in the sitting-room, Fred went\nup-stairs immediately and presented the letter to his uncle, who,\npropped up comfortably on a bed-rest, was not less able than usual to\nenjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating\nmankind. He put on his spectacles to read the letter, pursing up his\nlips and drawing down their corners."

He’s as fine as an\nauctioneer—_that your son Frederic has not obtained any advance of\nmoney on bequests promised by Mr. Featherstone_—promised? who said I\nhad ever promised? I promise nothing—I shall make codicils as long as I\nlike—_and that considering the nature of such a proceeding, it is\nunreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would\nattempt it_—ah, but the gentleman doesn’t say you are a young man of\nsense and character, mark you that, sir!—_As to my own concern with any\nreport of such a nature, I distinctly affirm that I never made any\nstatement to the effect that your son had borrowed money on any\nproperty that might accrue to him on Mr. Featherstone’s demise_—bless\nmy heart! ‘property’—accrue—demise! Lawyer Standish is nothing to him.\nHe couldn’t speak finer if he wanted to borrow. Well,” Mr. Featherstone\nhere looked over his spectacles at Fred, while he handed back the\nletter to him with a contemptuous gesture, “you don’t suppose I believe\na thing because Bulstrode writes it out fine, eh?”Fred colored. “You wished to have the letter, sir. I should think it\nvery likely that Mr. Bulstrode’s denial is as good as the authority\nwhich told you what he denies.”“Every bit. I never said I believed either one or the other. And now\nwhat d’ you expect?” said Mr. Featherstone, curtly, keeping on his\nspectacles, but withdrawing his hands under his wraps.“I expect nothing, sir.” Fred with difficulty restrained himself from\nventing his irritation. “I came to bring you the letter. If you like I\nwill bid you good morning.”“Not yet, not yet. Ring the bell; I want missy to come.”It was a servant who came in answer to the bell.“Tell missy to come!” said Mr. Featherstone, impatiently. “What\nbusiness had she to go away?” He spoke in the same tone when Mary came.“Why couldn’t you sit still here till I told you to go? I want my\nwaistcoat now. I told you always to put it on the bed.”Mary’s eyes looked rather red, as if she had been crying. It was clear\nthat Mr. Featherstone was in one of his most snappish humors this\nmorning, and though Fred had now the prospect of receiving the\nmuch-needed present of money, he would have preferred being free to\nturn round on the old tyrant and tell him that Mary Garth was too good\nto be at his beck. Though Fred had risen as she entered the room, she\nhad barely noticed him, and looked as if her nerves were quivering with\nthe expectation that something would be thrown at her. But she never\nhad anything worse than words to dread. When she went to reach the\nwaistcoat from a peg, Fred went up to her and said, “Allow me.”"

It was usual with him to season his\npleasure in showing favor to one person by being especially\ndisagreeable to another, and Mary was always at hand to furnish the\ncondiment. When his own relatives came she was treated better. Slowly\nhe took out a bunch of keys from the waistcoat pocket, and slowly he\ndrew forth a tin box which was under the bed-clothes.“You expect I am going to give you a little fortune, eh?” he said,\nlooking above his spectacles and pausing in the act of opening the lid.“Not at all, sir. You were good enough to speak of making me a present\nthe other day, else, of course, I should not have thought of the\nmatter.” But Fred was of a hopeful disposition, and a vision had\npresented itself of a sum just large enough to deliver him from a\ncertain anxiety. When Fred got into debt, it always seemed to him\nhighly probable that something or other—he did not necessarily conceive\nwhat—would come to pass enabling him to pay in due time. And now that\nthe providential occurrence was apparently close at hand, it would have\nbeen sheer absurdity to think that the supply would be short of the\nneed: as absurd as a faith that believed in half a miracle for want of\nstrength to believe in a whole one.The deep-veined hands fingered many bank-notes one after the other,\nlaying them down flat again, while Fred leaned back in his chair,\nscorning to look eager. He held himself to be a gentleman at heart, and\ndid not like courting an old fellow for his money. At last, Mr.\nFeatherstone eyed him again over his spectacles and presented him with\na little sheaf of notes: Fred could see distinctly that there were but\nfive, as the less significant edges gaped towards him. But then, each\nmight mean fifty pounds. He took them, saying—“I am very much obliged to you, sir,” and was going to roll them up\nwithout seeming to think of their value. But this did not suit Mr.\nFeatherstone, who was eying him intently.“Come, don’t you think it worth your while to count ’em? You take money\nlike a lord; I suppose you lose it like one.”“I thought I was not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, sir. But I\nshall be very happy to count them.”"

The collapse for Fred was severe when he found\nthat he held no more than five twenties, and his share in the higher\neducation of this country did not seem to help him. Nevertheless he\nsaid, with rapid changes in his fair complexion—“It is very handsome of you, sir.”“I should think it is,” said Mr. Featherstone, locking his box and\nreplacing it, then taking off his spectacles deliberately, and at\nlength, as if his inward meditation had more deeply convinced him,\nrepeating, “I should think it handsome.”“I assure you, sir, I am very grateful,” said Fred, who had had time to\nrecover his cheerful air.“So you ought to be. You want to cut a figure in the world, and I\nreckon Peter Featherstone is the only one you’ve got to trust to.” Here\nthe old man’s eyes gleamed with a curiously mingled satisfaction in the\nconsciousness that this smart young fellow relied upon him, and that\nthe smart young fellow was rather a fool for doing so.“Yes, indeed: I was not born to very splendid chances. Few men have\nbeen more cramped than I have been,” said Fred, with some sense of\nsurprise at his own virtue, considering how hardly he was dealt with.\n“It really seems a little too bad to have to ride a broken-winded\nhunter, and see men, who, are not half such good judges as yourself,\nable to throw away any amount of money on buying bad bargains.”“Well, you can buy yourself a fine hunter now. Eighty pound is enough\nfor that, I reckon—and you’ll have twenty pound over to get yourself\nout of any little scrape,” said Mr. Featherstone, chuckling slightly.“You are very good, sir,” said Fred, with a fine sense of contrast\nbetween the words and his feeling.“Ay, rather a better uncle than your fine uncle Bulstrode. You won’t\nget much out of his spekilations, I think. He’s got a pretty strong\nstring round your father’s leg, by what I hear, eh?”“My father never tells me anything about his affairs, sir.”“Well, he shows some sense there. But other people find ’em out without\nhis telling. _He’ll_ never have much to leave you: he’ll most-like die\nwithout a will—he’s the sort of man to do it—let ’em make him mayor of\nMiddlemarch as much as they like. But you won’t get much by his dying\nwithout a will, though you _are_ the eldest son.”"

True, he had never before given him quite so much money at\nonce.“Shall I destroy this letter of Mr. Bulstrode’s, sir?” said Fred,\nrising with the letter as if he would put it in the fire.“Ay, ay, I don’t want it. It’s worth no money to me.”Fred carried the letter to the fire, and thrust the poker through it\nwith much zest. He longed to get out of the room, but he was a little\nashamed before his inner self, as well as before his uncle, to run away\nimmediately after pocketing the money. Presently, the farm-bailiff came\nup to give his master a report, and Fred, to his unspeakable relief,\nwas dismissed with the injunction to come again soon.He had longed not only to be set free from his uncle, but also to find\nMary Garth. She was now in her usual place by the fire, with sewing in\nher hands and a book open on the little table by her side. Her eyelids\nhad lost some of their redness now, and she had her usual air of\nself-command.“Am I wanted up-stairs?” she said, half rising as Fred entered.“No; I am only dismissed, because Simmons is gone up.”Mary sat down again, and resumed her work. She was certainly treating\nhim with more indifference than usual: she did not know how\naffectionately indignant he had felt on her behalf up-stairs.“May I stay here a little, Mary, or shall I bore you?”“Pray sit down,” said Mary; “you will not be so heavy a bore as Mr.\nJohn Waule, who was here yesterday, and he sat down without asking my\nleave.”“Poor fellow! I think he is in love with you.”“I am not aware of it. And to me it is one of the most odious things in\na girl’s life, that there must always be some supposition of falling in\nlove coming between her and any man who is kind to her, and to whom she\nis grateful. I should have thought that I, at least, might have been\nsafe from all that. I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of\nfancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me.”Mary did not mean to betray any feeling, but in spite of herself she\nended in a tremulous tone of vexation."

I forgot what a great\nservice you think it if any one snuffs a candle for you.” Fred also had\nhis pride, and was not going to show that he knew what had called forth\nthis outburst of Mary’s.“Oh, I am not angry, except with the ways of the world. I do like to be\nspoken to as if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I could\nunderstand a little more than I ever hear even from young gentlemen who\nhave been to college.” Mary had recovered, and she spoke with a\nsuppressed rippling under-current of laughter pleasant to hear.“I don’t care how merry you are at my expense this morning,” said Fred,\n“I thought you looked so sad when you came up-stairs. It is a shame you\nshould stay here to be bullied in that way.”“Oh, I have an easy life—by comparison. I have tried being a teacher,\nand I am not fit for that: my mind is too fond of wandering on its own\nway. I think any hardship is better than pretending to do what one is\npaid for, and never really doing it. Everything here I can do as well\nas any one else could; perhaps better than some—Rosy, for example.\nThough she is just the sort of beautiful creature that is imprisoned\nwith ogres in fairy tales.”“_Rosy!_” cried Fred, in a tone of profound brotherly scepticism.“Come, Fred!” said Mary, emphatically; “you have no right to be so\ncritical.”“Do you mean anything particular—just now?”“No, I mean something general—always.”“Oh, that I am idle and extravagant. Well, I am not fit to be a poor\nman. I should not have made a bad fellow if I had been rich.”“You would have done your duty in that state of life to which it has\nnot pleased God to call you,” said Mary, laughing.“Well, I couldn’t do my duty as a clergyman, any more than you could do\nyours as a governess. You ought to have a little fellow-feeling there,\nMary.”“I never said you ought to be a clergyman. There are other sorts of\nwork. It seems to me very miserable not to resolve on some course and\nact accordingly.”“So I could, if—” Fred broke off, and stood up, leaning against the\nmantel-piece.“If you were sure you should not have a fortune?”“I did not say that. You want to quarrel with me. It is too bad of you\nto be guided by what other people say about me.”"

I should be quarrelling with all\nmy new books,” said Mary, lifting the volume on the table. “However\nnaughty you may be to other people, you are good to me.”“Because I like you better than any one else. But I know you despise\nme.”“Yes, I do—a little,” said Mary, nodding, with a smile.“You would admire a stupendous fellow, who would have wise opinions\nabout everything.”“Yes, I should.” Mary was sewing swiftly, and seemed provokingly\nmistress of the situation. When a conversation has taken a wrong turn\nfor us, we only get farther and farther into the swamp of awkwardness.\nThis was what Fred Vincy felt.“I suppose a woman is never in love with any one she has always\nknown—ever since she can remember; as a man often is. It is always some\nnew fellow who strikes a girl.”“Let me see,” said Mary, the corners of her mouth curling archly; “I\nmust go back on my experience. There is Juliet—she seems an example of\nwhat you say. But then Ophelia had probably known Hamlet a long while;\nand Brenda Troil—she had known Mordaunt Merton ever since they were\nchildren; but then he seems to have been an estimable young man; and\nMinna was still more deeply in love with Cleveland, who was a stranger.\nWaverley was new to Flora MacIvor; but then she did not fall in love\nwith him. And there are Olivia and Sophia Primrose, and Corinne—they\nmay be said to have fallen in love with new men. Altogether, my\nexperience is rather mixed.”Mary looked up with some roguishness at Fred, and that look of hers was\nvery dear to him, though the eyes were nothing more than clear windows\nwhere observation sat laughingly. He was certainly an affectionate\nfellow, and as he had grown from boy to man, he had grown in love with\nhis old playmate, notwithstanding that share in the higher education of\nthe country which had exalted his views of rank and income.“When a man is not loved, it is no use for him to say that he could be\na better fellow—could do anything—I mean, if he were sure of being\nloved in return.”“Not of the least use in the world for him to say he _could_ be better.\nMight, could, would—they are contemptible auxiliaries.”"

But if they love them, they never think them bad.”“It is hardly fair to say I am bad.”“I said nothing at all about you.”“I never shall be good for anything, Mary, if you will not say that you\nlove me—if you will not promise to marry me—I mean, when I am able to\nmarry.”“If I did love you, I would not marry you: I would certainly not\npromise ever to marry you.”“I think that is quite wicked, Mary. If you love me, you ought to\npromise to marry me.”“On the contrary, I think it would be wicked in me to marry you even if\nI did love you.”“You mean, just as I am, without any means of maintaining a wife. Of\ncourse: I am but three-and-twenty.”“In that last point you will alter. But I am not so sure of any other\nalteration. My father says an idle man ought not to exist, much less,\nbe married.”“Then I am to blow my brains out?”“No; on the whole I should think you would do better to pass your\nexamination.

I am ten times cleverer than many men who\npass.”“Dear me!” said Mary, unable to repress her sarcasm; “that accounts for\nthe curates like Mr. Crowse. Divide your cleverness by ten, and the\nquotient—dear me!—is able to take a degree. But that only shows you are\nten times more idle than the others.”“Well, if I did pass, you would not want me to go into the Church?”“That is not the question—what I want you to do. You have a conscience\nof your own, I suppose. There! there is Mr. Lydgate.

My father would think it a\ndisgrace to me if I accepted a man who got into debt, and would not\nwork!”Fred was stung, and released her hand. She walked to the door, but\nthere she turned and said: “Fred, you have always been so good, so\ngenerous to me. I am not ungrateful. But never speak to me in that way\nagain.”“Very well,” said Fred, sulkily, taking up his hat and whip. His\ncomplexion showed patches of pale pink and dead white. Like many a\nplucked idle young gentleman, he was thoroughly in love, and with a\nplain girl, who had no money! But having Mr. Featherstone’s land in the\nbackground, and a persuasion that, let Mary say what she would, she\nreally did care for him, Fred was not utterly in despair.When he got home, he gave four of the twenties to his mother, asking\nher to keep them for him. “I don’t want to spend that money, mother. I\nwant it to pay a debt with. So keep it safe away from my fingers.”“Bless you, my dear,” said Mrs. Vincy. She doted on her eldest son and\nher youngest girl (a child of six), whom others thought her two\nnaughtiest children. The mother’s eyes are not always deceived in their\npartiality: she at least can best judge who is the tender,\nfilial-hearted child. And Fred was certainly very fond of his mother.\nPerhaps it was his fondness for another person also that made him\nparticularly anxious to take some security against his own liability to\nspend the hundred pounds. For the creditor to whom he owed a hundred\nand sixty held a firmer security in the shape of a bill signed by\nMary’s father.CHAPTER XV.“Black eyes you have left, you say,\n    Blue eyes fail to draw you;\nYet you seem more rapt to-day,\n    Than of old we saw you.“Oh, I track the fairest fair\n    Through new haunts of pleasure;\nFootprints here and echoes there\n    Guide me to my treasure:“Lo! she turns—immortal youth\n    Wrought to mortal stature,\nFresh as starlight’s aged truth—\n    Many-namèd Nature!”"

  "content": "At present I have to make the new settler Lydgate better known to any\none interested in him than he could possibly be even to those who had\nseen the most of him since his arrival in Middlemarch. For surely all\nmust admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed,\ncounted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as\na future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown—known merely as a\ncluster of signs for his neighbors’ false suppositions. There was a\ngeneral impression, however, that Lydgate was not altogether a common\ncountry doctor, and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was\nsignificant of great things being expected from him. For everybody’s\nfamily doctor was remarkably clever, and was understood to have\nimmeasurable skill in the management and training of the most skittish\nor vicious diseases. The evidence of his cleverness was of the higher\nintuitive order, lying in his lady-patients’ immovable conviction, and\nwas unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were\nopposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw medical truth in\nWrench and “the strengthening treatment” regarding Toller and “the\nlowering system” as medical perdition. For the heroic times of copious\nbleeding and blistering had not yet departed, still less the times of\nthorough-going theory, when disease in general was called by some bad\nname, and treated accordingly without shilly-shally—as if, for example,\nit were to be called insurrection, which must not be fired on with\nblank-cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once. The strengtheners\nand the lowerers were all “clever” men in somebody’s opinion, which is\nreally as much as can be said for any living talents. Nobody’s\nimagination had gone so far as to conjecture that Mr. Lydgate could\nknow as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin, the two physicians, who\nalone could offer any hope when danger was extreme, and when the\nsmallest hope was worth a guinea. Still, I repeat, there was a general\nimpression that Lydgate was something rather more uncommon than any\ngeneral practitioner in Middlemarch. And this was true. He was but\nseven-and-twenty, an age at which many men are not quite common—at\nwhich they are hopeful of achievement, resolute in avoidance, thinking\nthat Mammon shall never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their\nbacks, but rather that Mammon, if they have anything to do with him,\nshall draw their chariot."

  "content": "He had been left an orphan when he was fresh from a public school. His\nfather, a military man, had made but little provision for three\nchildren, and when the boy Tertius asked to have a medical education,\nit seemed easier to his guardians to grant his request by apprenticing\nhim to a country practitioner than to make any objections on the score\nof family dignity. He was one of the rarer lads who early get a decided\nbent and make up their minds that there is something particular in life\nwhich they would like to do for its own sake, and not because their\nfathers did it. Most of us who turn to any subject with love remember\nsome morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down\nan untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker,\nor for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the\nfirst traceable beginning of our love. Something of that sort happened\nto Lydgate. He was a quick fellow, and when hot from play, would toss\nhimself in a corner, and in five minutes be deep in any sort of book\nthat he could lay his hands on: if it were Rasselas or Gulliver, so\nmuch the better, but Bailey’s Dictionary would do, or the Bible with\nthe Apocrypha in it. Something he must read, when he was not riding the\npony, or running and hunting, or listening to the talk of men. All this\nwas true of him at ten years of age; he had then read through “Chrysal,\nor the Adventures of a Guinea,” which was neither milk for babes, nor\nany chalky mixture meant to pass for milk, and it had already occurred\nto him that books were stuff, and that life was stupid. His school\nstudies had not much modified that opinion, for though he “did” his\nclassics and mathematics, he was not pre-eminent in them. It was said\nof him, that Lydgate could do anything he liked, but he had certainly\nnot yet liked to do anything remarkable. He was a vigorous animal with\na ready understanding, but no spark had yet kindled in him an\nintellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him a very superficial\naffair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of his elders,\nhe had apparently got already more than was necessary for mature life.\nProbably this was not an exceptional result of expensive teaching at\nthat period of short-waisted coats, and other fashions which have not\nyet recurred. But, one vacation, a wet day sent him to the small home\nlibrary to hunt once more for a book which might have some freshness\nfor him: in vain! unless, indeed, he took down a dusty row of volumes\nwith gray-paper backs and dingy labels—the volumes of an old\nCyclopaedia which he had never disturbed. It would at least be a\nnovelty to disturb them. They were on the highest shelf, and he stood\non a chair to get them down. But he opened the volume which he first\ntook from the shelf: somehow, one is apt to read in a makeshift\nattitude, just where it might seem inconvenient to do so. The page he\nopened on was under the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that\ndrew his eyes was on the valves of the heart. He was not much\nacquainted with valves of any sort, but he knew that valvae were\nfolding-doors, and through this crevice came a sudden light startling\nhim with his first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the\nhuman frame. A liberal education had of course left him free to read\nthe indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general\nsense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal\nstructure, had left his imagination quite unbiassed, so that for\nanything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples, and he\nhad no more thought of representing to himself how his blood circulated\nthan how paper served instead of gold. But the moment of vocation had\ncome, and before he got down from his chair, the world was made new to\nhim by a presentiment of endless processes filling the vast spaces\nplanked out of his sight by that wordy ignorance which he had supposed\nto be knowledge. From that hour Lydgate felt the growth of an\nintellectual passion."
