  "content": "Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was the\nbetter hope of him because his scientific interest soon took the form\nof a professional enthusiasm: he had a youthful belief in his\nbread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift\ncalled his ’prentice days; and he carried to his studies in London,\nEdinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical profession as it\nmight be was the finest in the world; presenting the most perfect\ninterchange between science and art; offering the most direct alliance\nbetween intellectual conquest and the social good. Lydgate’s nature\ndemanded this combination: he was an emotional creature, with a\nflesh-and-blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the\nabstractions of special study. He cared not only for “cases,” but for\nJohn and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth."

  "content": "There was another attraction in his profession: it wanted reform, and\ngave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its\nvenal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine\nthough undemanded qualifications. He went to study in Paris with the\ndetermination that when he came home again he would settle in some\nprovincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the irrational\nseverance between medical and surgical knowledge in the interest of his\nown scientific pursuits, as well as of the general advance: he would\nkeep away from the range of London intrigues, jealousies, and social\ntruckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as Jenner had done, by\nthe independent value of his work. For it must be remembered that this\nwas a dark period; and in spite of venerable colleges which used great\nefforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it scarce, and to\nexclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation to fees and\nappointments, it happened that very ignorant young gentlemen were\npromoted in town, and many more got a legal right to practise over\nlarge areas in the country. Also, the high standard held up to the\npublic mind by the College of Physicians, which gave its peculiar\nsanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction\nobtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery\nfrom having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice\nchiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred\nthat it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could only\nbe got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic\nprescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees.\nConsidering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to\nthe number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist\nin the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the\nunits was the most direct mode of changing the numbers. He meant to be\na unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that\nspreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the\naverages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an\nadvantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients. But he did\nnot simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He\nwas ambitious of a wider effect: he was fired with the possibility that\nhe might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link\nin the chain of discovery."

  "content": "Does it seem incongruous to you that a Middlemarch surgeon should dream\nof himself as a discoverer? Most of us, indeed, know little of the\ngreat originators until they have been lifted up among the\nconstellations and already rule our fates. But that Herschel, for\nexample, who “broke the barriers of the heavens”—did he not once play a\nprovincial church-organ, and give music-lessons to stumbling pianists?\nEach of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who\nperhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything\nwhich was to give him a title to everlasting fame: each of them had his\nlittle local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and\nsordid cares, which made the retarding friction of his course towards\nfinal companionship with the immortals. Lydgate was not blind to the\ndangers of such friction, but he had plenty of confidence in his\nresolution to avoid it as far as possible: being seven-and-twenty, he\nfelt himself experienced. And he was not going to have his vanities\nprovoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital,\nbut to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of\na great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice\nof his profession. There was fascination in the hope that the two\npurposes would illuminate each other: the careful observation and\ninference which was his daily work, the use of the lens to further his\njudgment in special cases, would further his thought as an instrument\nof larger inquiry. Was not this the typical pre-eminence of his\nprofession? He would be a good Middlemarch doctor, and by that very\nmeans keep himself in the track of far-reaching investigation. On one\npoint he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his\ncareer: he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make\na profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are\nexposing adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may\nhave leisure to represent the cause of public morality. He intended to\nbegin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite\ncertainly within his reach, and much less of a problem than the\ndemonstrating of an anatomical conception. One of these reforms was to\nact stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and simply\nprescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from\ndruggists. This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the\nstyle of general practitioner in a country town, and would be felt as\noffensive criticism by his professional brethren. But Lydgate meant to\ninnovate in his treatment also, and he was wise enough to see that the\nbest security for his practising honestly according to his belief was\nto get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary."

  "content": "Perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than\nthe present; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when\nAmerica was beginning to be discovered, when a bold sailor, even if he\nwere wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark\nterritories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young\nadventurer. Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards\nenlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession. The more he\nbecame interested in special questions of disease, such as the nature\nof fever or fevers, the more keenly he felt the need for that\nfundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the\ncentury had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of\nBichat, who died when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another\nAlexander, left a realm large enough for many heirs. That great\nFrenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies,\nfundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be\nunderstood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally;\nbut must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues,\nout of which the various organs—brain, heart, lungs, and so on—are\ncompacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in\nvarious proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest,\neach material having its peculiar composition and proportions. No man,\none sees, can understand and estimate the entire structure or its\nparts—what are its frailties and what its repairs, without knowing the\nnature of the materials. And the conception wrought out by Bichat, with\nhis detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on\nmedical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim,\noil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of\nstructure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms\nof maladies and the action of medicaments. But results which depend on\nhuman conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of\n1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the\nold paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might\nhave seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat’s. This great seer did\nnot go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the\nliving organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was\nopen to another mind to say, have not these structures some common\nbasis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net,\nsatin, and velvet from the raw cocoon? Here would be another light, as\nof oxy-hydrogen, showing the very grain of things, and revising all\nformer explanations. Of this sequence to Bichat’s work, already\nvibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was\nenamoured; he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of\nliving structure, and help to define men’s thought more accurately\nafter the true order. The work had not yet been done, but only prepared\nfor those who knew how to use the preparation. What was the primitive\ntissue? In that way Lydgate put the question—not quite in the way\nrequired by the awaiting answer; but such missing of the right word\nbefalls many seekers. And he counted on quiet intervals to be\nwatchfully seized, for taking up the threads of investigation—on many\nhints to be won from diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but\nof the microscope, which research had begun to use again with new\nenthusiasm of reliance. Such was Lydgate’s plan of his future: to do\ngood small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the world."

  "content": "He was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be seven-and-twenty,\nwithout any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his action\nshould be beneficent, and with ideas in his brain that made life\ninteresting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic\nrites of costly observance, which the eight hundred pounds left him\nafter buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying\nfor. He was at a starting-point which makes many a man’s career a fine\nsubject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that\namusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an\narduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of\ncircumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims\nand makes his point or else is carried headlong. The risk would remain\neven with close knowledge of Lydgate’s character; for character too is\na process and an unfolding. The man was still in the making, as much as\nthe Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer, and there were both\nvirtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding. The faults will\nnot, I hope, be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him.\nAmong our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little\ntoo self-confident and disdainful; whose distinguished mind is a little\nspotted with commonness; who is a little pinched here and protuberant\nthere with native prejudices; or whose better energies are liable to\nlapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient\nsolicitations? All these things might be alleged against Lydgate, but\nthen, they are the periphrases of a polite preacher, who talks of Adam,\nand would not like to mention anything painful to the pew-renters. The\nparticular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled\nhave distinguishable physiognomies, diction, accent, and grimaces;\nfilling up parts in very various dramas. Our vanities differ as our\nnoses do: all conceit is not the same conceit, but varies in\ncorrespondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us\ndiffers from another. Lydgate’s conceit was of the arrogant sort, never\nsimpering, never impertinent, but massive in its claims and\nbenevolently contemptuous. He would do a great deal for noodles, being\nsorry for them, and feeling quite sure that they could have no power\nover him: he had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he was in\nParis, in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines. All\nhis faults were marked by kindred traits, and were those of a man who\nhad a fine baritone, whose clothes hung well upon him, and who even in\nhis ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction. Where then lay\nthe spots of commonness? says a young lady enamoured of that careless\ngrace. How could there be any commonness in a man so well-bred, so\nambitious of social distinction, so generous and unusual in his views\nof social duty? As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius\nif you take him unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has\nthe best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in\nimagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach’s music,\nor the brilliant punning in the last burlesque. Lydgate’s spots of\ncommonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of\nnoble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in\nordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged to\nhis intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his feeling and judgment\nabout furniture, or women, or the desirability of its being known\n(without his telling) that he was better born than other country\nsurgeons. He did not mean to think of furniture at present; but\nwhenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes\nof reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there\nwould be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best."

  "content": "As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous\nfolly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant\nperiod would of course not be impetuous. For those who want to be\nacquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of\nimpetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving\nof passion to which he was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness\nwhich helped to make him morally lovable. The story can be told without\nmany words. It happened when he was studying in Paris, and just at the\ntime when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some\ngalvanic experiments. One evening, tired with his experimenting, and\nnot being able to elicit the facts he needed, he left his frogs and\nrabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation\nof unexplained shocks, and went to finish his evening at the theatre of\nthe Porte Saint Martin, where there was a melodrama which he had\nalready seen several times; attracted, not by the ingenious work of the\ncollaborating authors, but by an actress whose part it was to stab her\nlover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the piece. Lydgate\nwas in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he\nnever expects to speak to. She was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a\nGreek profile, and rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty\nwhich carries a sweet matronliness even in youth, and her voice was a\nsoft cooing. She had but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous\nreputation, her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover. It\nwas her acting which was “no better than it should be,” but the public\nwas satisfied. Lydgate’s only relaxation now was to go and look at this\nwoman, just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the\nsweet south on a bank of violets for a while, without prejudice to his\ngalvanism, to which he would presently return. But this evening the old\ndrama had a new catastrophe. At the moment when the heroine was to act\nthe stabbing of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife\nveritably stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed. A wild shriek\npierced the house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a\nswoon were demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this\ntime. Lydgate leaped and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the stage,\nand was active in help, making the acquaintance of his heroine by\nfinding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms.\nParis rang with the story of this death:—was it a murder? Some of the\nactress’s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt, and\nliked her the better for it (such was the taste of those times); but\nLydgate was not one of these. He vehemently contended for her\ninnocence, and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he\nhad felt before, had passed now into personal devotion, and tender\nthought of her lot. The notion of murder was absurd: no motive was\ndiscoverable, the young couple being understood to dote on each other;\nand it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should\nhave brought these grave consequences. The legal investigation ended in\nMadame Laure’s release. Lydgate by this time had had many interviews\nwith her, and found her more and more adorable. She talked little; but\nthat was an additional charm. She was melancholy, and seemed grateful;\nher presence was enough, like that of the evening light. Lydgate was\nmadly anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than\nhimself should win it and ask her to marry him. But instead of\nreopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would\nhave been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris\nwithout warning, forsaking her little court of admirers. Perhaps no one\ncarried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had come\nto a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by\never-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful\ncomforter. Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as\nsome other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered\nindications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons. He found her at\nlast acting with great success at Avignon under the same name, looking\nmore majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her\narms. He spoke to her after the play, was received with the usual\nquietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water, and\nobtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent on telling\nher that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him. He knew that\nthis was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his\nhabitual foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he was resolved\nto do. He had two selves within him apparently, and they must learn to\naccommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments. Strange, that\nsome of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our infatuations,\nand even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide plain where our\npersistent self pauses and awaits us."

  "content": "To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially\ntender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling\ntowards her.“You have come all the way from Paris to find me?” she said to him the\nnext day, sitting before him with folded arms, and looking at him with\neyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders.\n“Are all Englishmen like that?”“I came because I could not live without trying to see you. You are\nlonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait,\nbut I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one else.”Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under\nher grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt\nclose to her knees.“I will tell you something,” she said, in her cooing way, keeping her\narms folded. “My foot really slipped.”“I know, I know,” said Lydgate, deprecatingly. “It was a fatal\naccident—a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more.”Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, “_I meant to do\nit._”Lydgate, strong man as he was, turned pale and trembled: moments seemed\nto pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.“There was a secret, then,” he said at last, even vehemently. “He was\nbrutal to you: you hated him.”“No! he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and not in\nmy country; that was not agreeable to me.”“Great God!” said Lydgate, in a groan of horror. “And you planned to\nmurder him?”“I did not plan: it came to me in the play—_I meant to do it._”Lydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he\nlooked at her. He saw this woman—the first to whom he had given his\nyoung adoration—amid the throng of stupid criminals.“You are a good young man,” she said. “But I do not like husbands. I\nwill never have another.”"

  "content": "Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his Paris\nchambers, believing that illusions were at an end for him. He was saved\nfrom hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his\nbelief that human life might be made better. But he had more reason\nthan ever for trusting his judgment, now that it was so experienced;\nand henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman,\nentertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand.No one in Middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of Lydgate’s\npast as has here been faintly shadowed, and indeed the respectable\ntownsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager\nattempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did\nnot come under their own senses. Not only young virgins of that town,\nbut gray-bearded men also, were often in haste to conjecture how a new\nacquaintance might be wrought into their purposes, contented with very\nvague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for\nthat instrumentality. Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing\nLydgate and assimilating him very comfortably.CHAPTER XVI.“All that in woman is adored\n    In thy fair self I find—\nFor the whole sex can but afford\n    The handsome and the kind.”\n—SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain\nto the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and\nLydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power\nexercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode. The banker was evidently a\nruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among his supporters\nthere were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a\ncompromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general\nscheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you\nto hold a candle to the devil."

  "content": "Mr. Bulstrode’s power was not due simply to his being a country banker,\nwho knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could\ntouch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a beneficence\nthat was at once ready and severe—ready to confer obligations, and\nsevere in watching the result. He had gathered, as an industrious man\nalways at his post, a chief share in administering the town charities,\nand his private charities were both minute and abundant. He would take\na great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker’s son, and\nhe would watch over Tegg’s church-going; he would defend Mrs. Strype\nthe washerwoman against Stubbs’s unjust exaction on the score of her\ndrying-ground, and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs.\nStrype. His private minor loans were numerous, but he would inquire\nstrictly into the circumstances both before and after. In this way a\nman gathers a domain in his neighbors’ hope and fear as well as\ngratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region,\npropagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external\nmeans. It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as\npossible, that he might use it for the glory of God. He went through a\ngreat deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust\nhis motives, and make clear to himself what God’s glory required. But,\nas we have seen, his motives were not always rightly appreciated. There\nwere many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales could only\nweigh things in the lump; and they had a strong suspicion that since\nMr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion, eating and\ndrinking so little as he did, and worreting himself about everything,\nhe must have a sort of vampire’s feast in the sense of mastery.The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy’s table when Lydgate\nwas dining there, and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not,\nhe observed, prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the\nhost himself, though his reasons against the proposed arrangement\nturned entirely on his objection to Mr. Tyke’s sermons, which were all\ndoctrine, and his preference for Mr. Farebrother, whose sermons were\nfree from that taint. Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the\nchaplain’s having a salary, supposing it were given to Farebrother, who\nwas as good a little fellow as ever breathed, and the best preacher\nanywhere, and companionable too.“What line shall you take, then?” said Mr. Chichely, the coroner, a\ngreat coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy’s.“Oh, I’m precious glad I’m not one of the Directors now. I shall vote\nfor referring the matter to the Directors and the Medical Board\ntogether. I shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders,\nDoctor,” said Mr. Vincy, glancing first at Dr. Sprague, the senior\nphysician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat opposite. “You\nmedical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will\nprescribe, eh, Mr. Lydgate?”“I know little of either,” said Lydgate; “but in general, appointments\nare apt to be made too much a question of personal liking. The fittest\nman for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most\nagreeable. Sometimes, if you wanted to get a reform, your only way\nwould be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of, and\nput them out of the question.”"

  "content": "Dr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most “weight,” though\nDr. Minchin was usually said to have more “penetration,” divested his\nlarge heavy face of all expression, and looked at his wine-glass while\nLydgate was speaking. Whatever was not problematical and suspected\nabout this young man—for example, a certain showiness as to foreign\nideas, and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and\nforgotten by his elders—was positively unwelcome to a physician whose\nstanding had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on\nMeningitis, of which at least one copy marked “own” was bound in calf.\nFor my part I have some fellow-feeling with Dr. Sprague: one’s\nself-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very\nunpleasant to find deprecated.Lydgate’s remark, however, did not meet the sense of the company. Mr.\nVincy said, that if he could have _his_ way, he would not put\ndisagreeable fellows anywhere.“Hang your reforms!” said Mr. Chichely. “There’s no greater humbug in\nthe world. You never hear of a reform, but it means some trick to put\nin new men. I hope you are not one of the ‘Lancet’s’ men, Mr.\nLydgate—wanting to take the coronership out of the hands of the legal\nprofession: your words appear to point that way.”“I disapprove of Wakley,” interposed Dr. Sprague, “no man more: he is\nan ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the respectability of\nthe profession, which everybody knows depends on the London Colleges,\nfor the sake of getting some notoriety for himself. There are men who\ndon’t mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about.\nBut Wakley is right sometimes,” the Doctor added, judicially. “I could\nmention one or two points in which Wakley is in the right.”“Oh, well,” said Mr. Chichely, “I blame no man for standing up in favor\nof his own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like to know how a\ncoroner is to judge of evidence if he has not had a legal training?”“In my opinion,” said Lydgate, “legal training only makes a man more\nincompetent in questions that require knowledge of another kind. People\ntalk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales by a\nblind Justice. No man can judge what is good evidence on any particular\nsubject, unless he knows that subject well. A lawyer is no better than\nan old woman at a post-mortem examination. How is he to know the action\nof a poison? You might as well say that scanning verse will teach you\nto scan the potato crops.”“You are aware, I suppose, that it is not the coroner’s business to\nconduct the _post-mortem_, but only to take the evidence of the medical\nwitness?” said Mr. Chichely, with some scorn."

  "content": "“Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself,” said Lydgate.\n“Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance\nof decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the coroner ought not to\nbe a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the\nstomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell him so.”Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his\nMajesty’s coroner, and ended innocently with the question, “Don’t you\nagree with me, Dr. Sprague?”“To a certain extent—with regard to populous districts, and in the\nmetropolis,” said the Doctor. “But I hope it will be long before this\npart of the country loses the services of my friend Chichely, even\nthough it might get the best man in our profession to succeed him. I am\nsure Vincy will agree with me.”“Yes, yes, give me a coroner who is a good coursing man,” said Mr.\nVincy, jovially. “And in my opinion, you’re safest with a lawyer.\nNobody can know everything. Most things are ‘visitation of God.’ And as\nto poisoning, why, what you want to know is the law. Come, shall we\njoin the ladies?”Lydgate’s private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the very\ncoroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach, but he had not\nmeant to be personal. This was one of the difficulties of moving in\ngood Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a\nqualification for any salaried office. Fred Vincy had called Lydgate a\nprig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call him prick-eared;\nespecially when, in the drawing-room, he seemed to be making himself\neminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom he had easily monopolized in a\n_tête-à-tête_, since Mrs. Vincy herself sat at the tea-table. She\nresigned no domestic function to her daughter; and the matron’s\nblooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating\nfrom her fine throat, and her cheery manners to husband and children,\nwas certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy\nhouse—attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the\ndaughter. The tinge of unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in Mrs.\nVincy gave more effect to Rosamond’s refinement, which was beyond what\nLydgate had expected."

He regretted that he had\nnot heard her sing the other day at Stone Court. The only pleasure he\nallowed himself during the latter part of his stay in Paris was to go\nand hear music.“You have studied music, probably?” said Rosamond.“No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by ear;\nbut the music that I don’t know at all, and have no notion about,\ndelights me—affects me. How stupid the world is that it does not make\nmore use of such a pleasure within its reach!”“Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless. There are hardly any\ngood musicians. I only know two gentlemen who sing at all well.”“I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way,\nleaving you to fancy the tune—very much as if it were tapped on a\ndrum?”“Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer,” said Rosamond, with one of her rare\nsmiles. “But we are speaking very ill of our neighbors.”Lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation,\nin thinking how lovely this creature was, her garment seeming to be\nmade out of the faintest blue sky, herself so immaculately blond, as if\nthe petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her;\nand yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready,\nself-possessed grace. Since he had had the memory of Laure, Lydgate had\nlost all taste for large-eyed silence: the divine cow no longer\nattracted him, and Rosamond was her very opposite. But he recalled\nhimself.“You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.”“I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,” said Rosamond. “Papa is\nsure to insist on my singing. But I shall tremble before you, who have\nheard the best singers in Paris. I have heard very little: I have only\nonce been to London. But our organist at St. Peter’s is a good\nmusician, and I go on studying with him.”“Tell me what you saw in London.”"

But she remained simply serious, turned her long neck a\nlittle, and put up her hand to touch her wondrous hair-plaits—an\nhabitual gesture with her as pretty as any movements of a kitten’s paw.\nNot that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten: she was a sylph\ncaught young and educated at Mrs. Lemon’s.“I assure you my mind is raw,” she said immediately; “I pass at\nMiddlemarch. I am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors. But I am\nreally afraid of you.”“An accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men, though her\nknowledge is of a different sort. I am sure you could teach me a\nthousand things—as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were\nany common language between them. Happily, there is a common language\nbetween women and men, and so the bears can get taught.”“Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum! I must go and hinder him from\njarring all your nerves,” said Rosamond, moving to the other side of\nthe room, where Fred having opened the piano, at his father’s desire,\nthat Rosamond might give them some music, was parenthetically\nperforming “Cherry Ripe!” with one hand. Able men who have passed their\nexaminations will do these things sometimes, not less than the plucked\nFred.“Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make Mr.\nLydgate ill,” said Rosamond. “He has an ear.”Fred laughed, and went on with his tune to the end.Rosamond turned to Lydgate, smiling gently, and said, “You perceive,\nthe bears will not always be taught.”“Now then, Rosy!” said Fred, springing from the stool and twisting it\nupward for her, with a hearty expectation of enjoyment. “Some good\nrousing tunes first.”"

  "content": "Rosamond played admirably. Her master at Mrs. Lemon’s school (close to\na county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church\nand castle) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be\nfound in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted\nKapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of\nmusical celebrity. Rosamond, with the executant’s instinct, had seized\nhis manner of playing, and gave forth his large rendering of noble\nmusic with the precision of an echo. It was almost startling, heard for\nthe first time. A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from\nRosamond’s fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in\nperpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an\noriginating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter. Lydgate was\ntaken possession of, and began to believe in her as something\nexceptional. After all, he thought, one need not be surprised to find\nthe rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently\nunfavorable: come where they may, they always depend on conditions that\nare not obvious. He sat looking at her, and did not rise to pay her any\ncompliments, leaving that to others, now that his admiration was\ndeepened.Her singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and sweet to\nhear as a chime perfectly in tune. It is true she sang “Meet me by\nmoonlight,” and “I’ve been roaming”; for mortals must share the\nfashions of their time, and none but the ancients can be always\nclassical. But Rosamond could also sing “Black-eyed Susan” with effect,\nor Haydn’s canzonets, or “Voi, che sapete,” or “Batti, batti”—she only\nwanted to know what her audience liked."

  "content": "Her father looked round at the company, delighting in their admiration.\nHer mother sat, like a Niobe before her troubles, with her youngest\nlittle girl on her lap, softly beating the child’s hand up and down in\ntime to the music. And Fred, notwithstanding his general scepticism\nabout Rosy, listened to her music with perfect allegiance, wishing he\ncould do the same thing on his flute. It was the pleasantest family\nparty that Lydgate had seen since he came to Middlemarch. The Vincys\nhad the readiness to enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the\nbelief in life as a merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most\ncounty towns at that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain\nsuspicion as of plague-infection over the few amusements which survived\nin the provinces. At the Vincys’ there was always whist, and the\ncard-tables stood ready now, making some of the company secretly\nimpatient of the music. Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in—a\nhandsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose\nblack was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in his quick gray\neyes. He came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little\nLouisa with fatherly nonsense as she was being led out of the room by\nMiss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and seeming to\ncondense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the\nevening. He claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come\nand see him. “I can’t let you off, you know, because I have some\nbeetles to show you. We collectors feel an interest in every new man\ntill he has seen all we have to show him.”But soon he swerved to the whist-table, rubbing his hands and saying,\n“Come now, let us be serious! Mr. Lydgate? not play? Ah! you are too\nyoung and light for this kind of thing.”Lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so\npainful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable resort in\nthis certainly not erudite household. He could half understand it: the\ngood-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for\npassing the time without any labor of intelligence, might make the\nhouse beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd\nhours.Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was\nbrown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,\njust the sort of person for a governess. Lydgate did not mean to pay\nmany such visits himself. They were a wretched waste of the evenings;\nand now, when he had talked a little more to Rosamond, he meant to\nexcuse himself and go.“You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure,” she said, when the\nwhist-players were settled. “We are very stupid, and you have been used\nto something quite different.”“I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike,” said Lydgate. “But\nI have noticed that one always believes one’s own town to be more\nstupid than any other. I have made up my mind to take Middlemarch as it\ncomes, and shall be much obliged if the town will take me in the same\nway. I have certainly found some charms in it which are much greater\nthan I had expected.”“You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is pleased\nwith those,” said Rosamond, with simplicity.“No, I mean something much nearer to me.”Rosamond rose and reached her netting, and then said, “Do you care\nabout dancing at all? I am not quite sure whether clever men ever\ndance.”“I would dance with you if you would allow me.”"

  "content": "“Oh!” said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh. “I was only going\nto say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know whether you\nwould feel insulted if you were asked to come.”“Not on the condition I mentioned.”After this chat Lydgate thought that he was going, but on moving\ntowards the whist-tables, he got interested in watching Mr.\nFarebrother’s play, which was masterly, and also his face, which was a\nstriking mixture of the shrewd and the mild. At ten o’clock supper was\nbrought in (such were the customs of Middlemarch) and there was\npunch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water. He was\nwinning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers\nshould end, and Lydgate at last took his leave.But as it was not eleven o’clock, he chose to walk in the brisk air\ntowards the tower of St. Botolph’s, Mr. Farebrother’s church, which\nstood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight. It was the\noldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but a vicarage\nworth barely four hundred a-year. Lydgate had heard that, and he\nwondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money he won at\ncards; thinking, “He seems a very pleasant fellow, but Bulstrode may\nhave his good reasons.” Many things would be easier to Lydgate if it\nshould turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was generally justifiable. “What is\nhis religious doctrine to me, if he carries some good notions along\nwith it? One must use such brains as are to be found.”"

  "content": "These were actually Lydgate’s first meditations as he walked away from\nMr. Vincy’s, and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider\nhim hardly worthy of their attention. He thought of Rosamond and her\nmusic only in the second place; and though, when her turn came, he\ndwelt on the image of her for the rest of his walk, he felt no\nagitation, and had no sense that any new current had set into his life.\nHe could not marry yet; he wished not to marry for several years; and\ntherefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love\nwith a girl whom he happened to admire. He did admire Rosamond\nexceedingly; but that madness which had once beset him about Laure was\nnot, he thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman.\nCertainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would\nhave been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just\nthe kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished, refined,\ndocile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life, and\nenshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration\nthat excluded the need for other evidence. Lydgate felt sure that if\never he married, his wife would have that feminine radiance, that\ndistinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music,\nthat sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous, being\nmoulded only for pure and delicate joys.But since he did not mean to marry for the next five years—his more\npressing business was to look into Louis’ new book on Fever, which he\nwas specially interested in, because he had known Louis in Paris, and\nhad followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the\nspecific differences of typhus and typhoid. He went home and read far\ninto the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details\nand relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it\nnecessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these\nbeing subjects on which he felt himself amply informed by literature,\nand that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial\nconversation of men. Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave him\nthat delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere\narbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power—combining and\nconstructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest\nobedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with\nimpartial Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its\nown work."

  "content": "Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of\ntheir profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:—reports of\nvery poor talk going on in distant orbs; or portraits of Lucifer coming\ndown on his bad errands as a large ugly man with bat’s wings and spurts\nof phosphorescence; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to reflect\nlife in a diseased dream. But these kinds of inspiration Lydgate\nregarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that\nreveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of lens, but tracked in\nthat outer darkness through long pathways of necessary sequence by the\ninward light which is the last refinement of Energy, capable of bathing\neven the ethereal atoms in its ideally illuminated space. He for his\npart had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds itself\nable and at ease: he was enamoured of that arduous invention which is\nthe very eye of research, provisionally framing its object and\ncorrecting it to more and more exactness of relation; he wanted to\npierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human\nmisery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares which are the first\nlurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate poise and\ntransition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy\nconsciousness.As he threw down his book, stretched his legs towards the embers in the\ngrate, and clasped his hands at the back of his head, in that agreeable\nafterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a\nspecific object into a suffusive sense of its connections with all the\nrest of our existence—seems, as it were, to throw itself on its back\nafter vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted\nstrength—Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies, and\nsomething like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his\nprofession.“If I had not taken that turn when I was a lad,” he thought, “I might\nhave got into some stupid draught-horse work or other, and lived always\nin blinkers. I should never have been happy in any profession that did\nnot call forth the highest intellectual strain, and yet keep me in good\nwarm contact with my neighbors. There is nothing like the medical\nprofession for that: one can have the exclusive scientific life that\ntouches the distance and befriend the old fogies in the parish too. It\nis rather harder for a clergyman: Farebrother seems to be an anomaly.”This last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures of the\nevening. They floated in his mind agreeably enough, and as he took up\nhis bed-candle his lips were curled with that incipient smile which is\napt to accompany agreeable recollections. He was an ardent fellow, but\nat present his ardor was absorbed in love of his work and in the\nambition of making his life recognized as a factor in the better life\nof mankind—like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure\ncountry practice to begin with."
