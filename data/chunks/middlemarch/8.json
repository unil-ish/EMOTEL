  "content": "However, Dorothea was crying, and if she had been required to state the\ncause, she could only have done so in some such general words as I have\nalready used: to have been driven to be more particular would have been\nlike trying to give a history of the lights and shadows, for that new\nreal future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from\nthe endless minutiae by which her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely\nrelation, now that she was married to him, was gradually changing with\nthe secret motion of a watch-hand from what it had been in her maiden\ndream. It was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least\nadmit the change, still more for her to have readjusted that\ndevotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she\nwas almost sure sooner or later to recover it. Permanent rebellion, the\ndisorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve, was not\npossible to her; but she was now in an interval when the very force of\nher nature heightened its confusion. In this way, the early months of\nmarriage often are times of critical tumult—whether that of a\nshrimp-pool or of deeper waters—which afterwards subsides into cheerful\npeace.But was not Mr. Casaubon just as learned as before? Had his forms of\nexpression changed, or his sentiments become less laudable? Oh\nwaywardness of womanhood! did his chronology fail him, or his ability\nto state not only a theory but the names of those who held it; or his\nprovision for giving the heads of any subject on demand? And was not\nRome the place in all the world to give free play to such\naccomplishments? Besides, had not Dorothea’s enthusiasm especially\ndwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight and perhaps the sadness\nwith which great tasks lie on him who has to achieve them?— And that\nsuch weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was only plainer than before.All these are crushing questions; but whatever else remained the same,\nthe light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at noonday.\nThe fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are\nacquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few\nimaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of\nmarried companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than\nwhat you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether\nthe same. And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is\nfelt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it. To share lodgings\nwith a brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite politician\nin the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in these cases\ntoo we begin by knowing little and believing much, and we sometimes end\nby inverting the quantities."

  "content": "Still, such comparisons might mislead, for no man was more incapable of\nflashy make-believe than Mr. Casaubon: he was as genuine a character as\nany ruminant animal, and he had not actively assisted in creating any\nillusions about himself. How was it that in the weeks since her\nmarriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling\ndepression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had\ndreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and\nwinding passages which seemed to lead nowhither? I suppose it was that\nin courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and\nthe smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee\ndelightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal. But\nthe door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on\nthe present. Having once embarked on your marital voyage, it is\nimpossible not to be aware that you make no way and that the sea is not\nwithin sight—that, in fact, you are exploring an enclosed basin.In their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on\nsome explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see\nthe bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness\nof their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she\nhad listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments\nto be brought against Mr. Casaubon’s entirely new view of the\nPhilistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter\nshe should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same\nhigh ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him. Again,\nthe matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he\ntreated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily\naccounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in\nwhich she herself shared during their engagement. But now, since they\nhad been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to\ntumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements,\nshe had been becoming more and more aware, with a certain terror, that\nher mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and\nrepulsion, or else into forlorn weariness. How far the judicious Hooker\nor any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr.\nCasaubon’s time of life, she had no means of knowing, so that he could\nnot have the advantage of comparison; but her husband’s way of\ncommenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to\naffect her with a sort of mental shiver: he had perhaps the best\nintention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting\nhimself. What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his; and such\ncapacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by\nthe general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried\npreparation, a lifeless embalmment of knowledge."

  "content": "When he said, “Does this interest you, Dorothea? Shall we stay a little\nlonger? I am ready to stay if you wish it,”—it seemed to her as if\ngoing or staying were alike dreary. Or, “Should you like to go to the\nFarnesina, Dorothea? It contains celebrated frescos designed or painted\nby Raphael, which most persons think it worth while to visit.”“But do you care about them?” was always Dorothea’s question.“They are, I believe, highly esteemed. Some of them represent the fable\nof Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic invention of a\nliterary period, and cannot, I think, be reckoned as a genuine mythical\nproduct. But if you like these wall-paintings we can easily drive\nthither; and you will then, I think, have seen the chief works of\nRaphael, any of which it were a pity to omit in a visit to Rome. He is\nthe painter who has been held to combine the most complete grace of\nform with sublimity of expression. Such at least I have gathered to be\nthe opinion of cognoscenti.”This kind of answer given in a measured official tone, as of a\nclergyman reading according to the rubric, did not help to justify the\nglories of the Eternal City, or to give her the hope that if she knew\nmore about them the world would be joyously illuminated for her. There\nis hardly any contact more depressing to a young ardent creature than\nthat of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in\na blank absence of interest or sympathy.On other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of occupation\nand an eagerness which are usually regarded as the effect of\nenthusiasm, and Dorothea was anxious to follow this spontaneous\ndirection of his thoughts, instead of being made to feel that she\ndragged him away from it. But she was gradually ceasing to expect with\nher former delightful confidence that she should see any wide opening\nwhere she followed him. Poor Mr. Casaubon himself was lost among small\nclosets and winding stairs, and in an agitated dimness about the\nCabeiri, or in an exposure of other mythologists’ ill-considered\nparallels, easily lost sight of any purpose which had prompted him to\nthese labors. With his taper stuck before him he forgot the absence of\nwindows, and in bitter manuscript remarks on other men’s notions about\nthe solar deities, he had become indifferent to the sunlight."

  "content": "These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon,\nmight have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been\nencouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he would\nhave held her hands between his and listened with the delight of\ntenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up\nher experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in\nreturn, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual\nknowledge and affection—or if she could have fed her affection with\nthose childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who\nhas begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll,\ncreating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own\nlove. That was Dorothea’s bent. With all her yearning to know what was\nafar from her and to be widely benignant, she had ardor enough for what\nwas near, to have kissed Mr. Casaubon’s coat-sleeve, or to have\ncaressed his shoe-latchet, if he would have made any other sign of\nacceptance than pronouncing her, with his unfailing propriety, to be of\na most affectionate and truly feminine nature, indicating at the same\ntime by politely reaching a chair for her that he regarded these\nmanifestations as rather crude and startling. Having made his clerical\ntoilet with due care in the morning, he was prepared only for those\namenities of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat\nof the period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter.And by a sad contradiction Dorothea’s ideas and resolves seemed like\nmelting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they had been\nbut another form. She was humiliated to find herself a mere victim of\nfeeling, as if she could know nothing except through that medium: all\nher strength was scattered in fits of agitation, of struggle, of\ndespondency, and then again in visions of more complete renunciation,\ntransforming all hard conditions into duty. Poor Dorothea! she was\ncertainly troublesome—to herself chiefly; but this morning for the\nfirst time she had been troublesome to Mr. Casaubon.She had begun, while they were taking coffee, with a determination to\nshake off what she inwardly called her selfishness, and turned a face\nall cheerful attention to her husband when he said, “My dear Dorothea,\nwe must now think of all that is yet left undone, as a preliminary to\nour departure. I would fain have returned home earlier that we might\nhave been at Lowick for the Christmas; but my inquiries here have been\nprotracted beyond their anticipated period. I trust, however, that the\ntime here has not been passed unpleasantly to you. Among the sights of\nEurope, that of Rome has ever been held one of the most striking and in\nsome respects edifying. I well remember that I considered it an epoch\nin my life when I visited it for the first time; after the fall of\nNapoleon, an event which opened the Continent to travellers. Indeed I\nthink it is one among several cities to which an extreme hyperbole has\nbeen applied—‘See Rome and die:’ but in your case I would propose an\nemendation and say, See Rome as a bride, and live henceforth as a happy\nwife.”"

  "content": "Mr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most conscientious\nintention, blinking a little and swaying his head up and down, and\nconcluding with a smile. He had not found marriage a rapturous state,\nbut he had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable\nhusband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she deserved\nto be.“I hope you are thoroughly satisfied with our stay—I mean, with the\nresult so far as your studies are concerned,” said Dorothea, trying to\nkeep her mind fixed on what most affected her husband.“Yes,” said Mr. Casaubon, with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes\nthe word half a negative. “I have been led farther than I had foreseen,\nand various subjects for annotation have presented themselves which,\nthough I have no direct need of them, I could not pretermit. The task,\nnotwithstanding the assistance of my amanuensis, has been a somewhat\nlaborious one, but your society has happily prevented me from that too\ncontinuous prosecution of thought beyond the hours of study which has\nbeen the snare of my solitary life.”“I am very glad that my presence has made any difference to you,” said\nDorothea, who had a vivid memory of evenings in which she had supposed\nthat Mr. Casaubon’s mind had gone too deep during the day to be able to\nget to the surface again. I fear there was a little temper in her\nreply. “I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall be more useful to you,\nand be able to enter a little more into what interests you.”“Doubtless, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow. “The notes\nI have here made will want sifting, and you can, if you please, extract\nthem under my direction.”“And all your notes,” said Dorothea, whose heart had already burned\nwithin her on this subject, so that now she could not help speaking\nwith her tongue. “All those rows of volumes—will you not now do what\nyou used to speak of?—will you not make up your mind what part of them\nyou will use, and begin to write the book which will make your vast\nknowledge useful to the world? I will write to your dictation, or I\nwill copy and extract what you tell me: I can be of no other use.”\nDorothea, in a most unaccountable, darkly feminine manner, ended with a\nslight sob and eyes full of tears."

  "content": "The excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly\ndisturbing to Mr. Casaubon, but there were other reasons why Dorothea’s\nwords were among the most cutting and irritating to him that she could\nhave been impelled to use. She was as blind to his inward troubles as\nhe to hers: she had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her\nhusband which claim our pity. She had not yet listened patiently to his\nheartbeats, but only felt that her own was beating violently. In Mr.\nCasaubon’s ear, Dorothea’s voice gave loud emphatic iteration to those\nmuffled suggestions of consciousness which it was possible to explain\nas mere fancy, the illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness: always when\nsuch suggestions are unmistakably repeated from without, they are\nresisted as cruel and unjust. We are angered even by the full\nacceptance of our humiliating confessions—how much more by hearing in\nhard distinct syllables from the lips of a near observer, those\nconfused murmurs which we try to call morbid, and strive against as if\nthey were the oncoming of numbness! And this cruel outward accuser was\nthere in the shape of a wife—nay, of a young bride, who, instead of\nobserving his abundant pen-scratches and amplitude of paper with the\nuncritical awe of an elegant-minded canary-bird, seemed to present\nherself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of inference.\nHere, towards this particular point of the compass, Mr. Casaubon had a\nsensitiveness to match Dorothea’s, and an equal quickness to imagine\nmore than the fact. He had formerly observed with approbation her\ncapacity for worshipping the right object; he now foresaw with sudden\nterror that this capacity might be replaced by presumption, this\nworship by the most exasperating of all criticism,—that which sees\nvaguely a great many fine ends, and has not the least notion what it\ncosts to reach them.For the first time since Dorothea had known him, Mr. Casaubon’s face\nhad a quick angry flush upon it.“My love,” he said, with irritation reined in by propriety, “you may\nrely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the\ndifferent stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile\nconjectures of ignorant onlookers. It had been easy for me to gain a\ntemporary effect by a mirage of baseless opinion; but it is ever the\ntrial of the scrupulous explorer to be saluted with the impatient scorn\nof chatterers who attempt only the smallest achievements, being indeed\nequipped for no other. And it were well if all such could be admonished\nto discriminate judgments of which the true subject-matter lies\nentirely beyond their reach, from those of which the elements may be\ncompassed by a narrow and superficial survey.”This speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite unusual\nwith Mr. Casaubon. It was not indeed entirely an improvisation, but had\ntaken shape in inward colloquy, and rushed out like the round grains\nfrom a fruit when sudden heat cracks it. Dorothea was not only his\nwife: she was a personification of that shallow world which surrounds\nthe appreciated or desponding author.Dorothea was indignant in her turn. Had she not been repressing\neverything in herself except the desire to enter into some fellowship\nwith her husband’s chief interests?“My judgment _was_ a very superficial one—such as I am capable of\nforming,” she answered, with a prompt resentment, that needed no\nrehearsal. “You showed me the rows of notebooks—you have often spoken\nof them—you have often said that they wanted digesting. But I never\nheard you speak of the writing that is to be published. Those were very\nsimple facts, and my judgment went no farther. I only begged you to let\nme be of some good to you.”"

  "content": "Dorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply, taking\nup a letter which lay beside him as if to reperuse it. Both were\nshocked at their mutual situation—that each should have betrayed anger\ntowards the other. If they had been at home, settled at Lowick in\nordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would have been less\nembarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express object of which is\nto isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each\nother, the sense of disagreement is, to say the least, confounding and\nstultifying. To have changed your longitude extensively and placed\nyourselves in a moral solitude in order to have small explosions, to\nfind conversation difficult and to hand a glass of water without\nlooking, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory fulfilment even to the\ntoughest minds. To Dorothea’s inexperienced sensitiveness, it seemed\nlike a catastrophe, changing all prospects; and to Mr. Casaubon it was\na new pain, he never having been on a wedding journey before, or found\nhimself in that close union which was more of a subjection than he had\nbeen able to imagine, since this charming young bride not only obliged\nhim to much consideration on her behalf (which he had sedulously\ngiven), but turned out to be capable of agitating him cruelly just\nwhere he most needed soothing. Instead of getting a soft fence against\nthe cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his life, had he only given\nit a more substantial presence?Neither of them felt it possible to speak again at present. To have\nreversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been\na show of persistent anger which Dorothea’s conscience shrank from,\nseeing that she already began to feel herself guilty. However just her\nindignation might be, her ideal was not to claim justice, but to give\ntenderness. So when the carriage came to the door, she drove with Mr.\nCasaubon to the Vatican, walked with him through the stony avenue of\ninscriptions, and when she parted with him at the entrance to the\nLibrary, went on through the Museum out of mere listlessness as to what\nwas around her. She had not spirit to turn round and say that she would\ndrive anywhere. It was when Mr. Casaubon was quitting her that Naumann\nhad first seen her, and he had entered the long gallery of sculpture at\nthe same time with her; but here Naumann had to await Ladislaw with\nwhom he was to settle a bet of champagne about an enigmatical\nmediaeval-looking figure there. After they had examined the figure, and\nhad walked on finishing their dispute, they had parted, Ladislaw\nlingering behind while Naumann had gone into the Hall of Statues where\nhe again saw Dorothea, and saw her in that brooding abstraction which\nmade her pose remarkable. She did not really see the streak of sunlight\non the floor more than she saw the statues: she was inwardly seeing the\nlight of years to come in her own home and over the English fields and\nelms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that the way in which\nthey might be filled with joyful devotedness was not so clear to her as\nit had been. But in Dorothea’s mind there was a current into which all\nthought and feeling were apt sooner or later to flow—the reaching\nforward of the whole consciousness towards the fullest truth, the least\npartial good. There was clearly something better than anger and\ndespondency.CHAPTER XXI.“Hire facounde eke full womanly and plain,\nNo contrefeted termes had she\nTo semen wise.”\n—CHAUCER."

  "content": "It was in that way Dorothea came to be sobbing as soon as she was\nsecurely alone. But she was presently roused by a knock at the door,\nwhich made her hastily dry her eyes before saying, “Come in.” Tantripp\nhad brought a card, and said that there was a gentleman waiting in the\nlobby. The courier had told him that only Mrs. Casaubon was at home,\nbut he said he was a relation of Mr. Casaubon’s: would she see him?“Yes,” said Dorothea, without pause; “show him into the salon.” Her\nchief impressions about young Ladislaw were that when she had seen him\nat Lowick she had been made aware of Mr. Casaubon’s generosity towards\nhim, and also that she had been interested in his own hesitation about\nhis career. She was alive to anything that gave her an opportunity for\nactive sympathy, and at this moment it seemed as if the visit had come\nto shake her out of her self-absorbed discontent—to remind her of her\nhusband’s goodness, and make her feel that she had now the right to be\nhis helpmate in all kind deeds. She waited a minute or two, but when\nshe passed into the next room there were just signs enough that she had\nbeen crying to make her open face look more youthful and appealing than\nusual. She met Ladislaw with that exquisite smile of good-will which is\nunmixed with vanity, and held out her hand to him. He was the elder by\nseveral years, but at that moment he looked much the younger, for his\ntransparent complexion flushed suddenly, and he spoke with a shyness\nextremely unlike the ready indifference of his manner with his male\ncompanion, while Dorothea became all the calmer with a wondering desire\nto put him at ease.“I was not aware that you and Mr. Casaubon were in Rome, until this\nmorning, when I saw you in the Vatican Museum,” he said. “I knew you at\nonce—but—I mean, that I concluded Mr. Casaubon’s address would be found\nat the Poste Restante, and I was anxious to pay my respects to him and\nyou as early as possible.”“Pray sit down. He is not here now, but he will be glad to hear of you,\nI am sure,” said Dorothea, seating herself unthinkingly between the\nfire and the light of the tall window, and pointing to a chair\nopposite, with the quietude of a benignant matron. The signs of girlish\nsorrow in her face were only the more striking. “Mr. Casaubon is much\nengaged; but you will leave your address—will you not?—and he will\nwrite to you.”"

  "content": "“You are very good,” said Ladislaw, beginning to lose his diffidence in\nthe interest with which he was observing the signs of weeping which had\naltered her face. “My address is on my card. But if you will allow me I\nwill call again to-morrow at an hour when Mr. Casaubon is likely to be\nat home.”“He goes to read in the Library of the Vatican every day, and you can\nhardly see him except by an appointment. Especially now. We are about\nto leave Rome, and he is very busy. He is usually away almost from\nbreakfast till dinner. But I am sure he will wish you to dine with us.”Will Ladislaw was struck mute for a few moments. He had never been fond\nof Mr. Casaubon, and if it had not been for the sense of obligation,\nwould have laughed at him as a Bat of erudition. But the idea of this\ndried-up pedant, this elaborator of small explanations about as\nimportant as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a vendor’s\nback chamber, having first got this adorable young creature to marry\nhim, and then passing his honeymoon away from her, groping after his\nmouldy futilities (Will was given to hyperbole)—this sudden picture\nstirred him with a sort of comic disgust: he was divided between the\nimpulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse to burst\ninto scornful invective.For an instant he felt that the struggle was causing a queer contortion\nof his mobile features, but with a good effort he resolved it into\nnothing more offensive than a merry smile.Dorothea wondered; but the smile was irresistible, and shone back from\nher face too. Will Ladislaw’s smile was delightful, unless you were\nangry with him beforehand: it was a gush of inward light illuminating\nthe transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve\nand line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and\nbanishing forever the traces of moodiness. The reflection of that smile\ncould not but have a little merriment in it too, even under dark\neyelashes still moist, as Dorothea said inquiringly, “Something amuses\nyou?”“Yes,” said Will, quick in finding resources. “I am thinking of the\nsort of figure I cut the first time I saw you, when you annihilated my\npoor sketch with your criticism.”"

  "content": "“My criticism?” said Dorothea, wondering still more. “Surely not. I\nalways feel particularly ignorant about painting.”“I suspected you of knowing so much, that you knew how to say just what\nwas most cutting. You said—I dare say you don’t remember it as I\ndo—that the relation of my sketch to nature was quite hidden from you.\nAt least, you implied that.” Will could laugh now as well as smile.“That was really my ignorance,” said Dorothea, admiring Will’s\ngood-humor. “I must have said so only because I never could see any\nbeauty in the pictures which my uncle told me all judges thought very\nfine. And I have gone about with just the same ignorance in Rome. There\nare comparatively few paintings that I can really enjoy. At first when\nI enter a room where the walls are covered with frescos, or with rare\npictures, I feel a kind of awe—like a child present at great ceremonies\nwhere there are grand robes and processions; I feel myself in the\npresence of some higher life than my own. But when I begin to examine\nthe pictures one by one the life goes out of them, or else is something\nviolent and strange to me. It must be my own dulness. I am seeing so\nmuch all at once, and not understanding half of it. That always makes\none feel stupid. It is painful to be told that anything is very fine\nand not be able to feel that it is fine—something like being blind,\nwhile people talk of the sky.”“Oh, there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be\nacquired,” said Will. (It was impossible now to doubt the directness of\nDorothea’s confession.) “Art is an old language with a great many\nartificial affected styles, and sometimes the chief pleasure one gets\nout of knowing them is the mere sense of knowing. I enjoy the art of\nall sorts here immensely; but I suppose if I could pick my enjoyment to\npieces I should find it made up of many different threads. There is\nsomething in daubing a little one’s self, and having an idea of the\nprocess.”"

  "content": "“You mean perhaps to be a painter?” said Dorothea, with a new direction\nof interest. “You mean to make painting your profession? Mr. Casaubon\nwill like to hear that you have chosen a profession.”“No, oh no,” said Will, with some coldness. “I have quite made up my\nmind against it. It is too one-sided a life. I have been seeing a great\ndeal of the German artists here: I travelled from Frankfort with one of\nthem. Some are fine, even brilliant fellows—but I should not like to\nget into their way of looking at the world entirely from the studio\npoint of view.”“That I can understand,” said Dorothea, cordially. “And in Rome it\nseems as if there were so many things which are more wanted in the\nworld than pictures. But if you have a genius for painting, would it\nnot be right to take that as a guide? Perhaps you might do better\nthings than these—or different, so that there might not be so many\npictures almost all alike in the same place.”There was no mistaking this simplicity, and Will was won by it into\nfrankness. “A man must have a very rare genius to make changes of that\nsort. I am afraid mine would not carry me even to the pitch of doing\nwell what has been done already, at least not so well as to make it\nworth while. And I should never succeed in anything by dint of\ndrudgery. If things don’t come easily to me I never get them.”“I have heard Mr. Casaubon say that he regrets your want of patience,”\nsaid Dorothea, gently. She was rather shocked at this mode of taking\nall life as a holiday.“Yes, I know Mr. Casaubon’s opinion. He and I differ.”The slight streak of contempt in this hasty reply offended Dorothea.\nShe was all the more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of her\nmorning’s trouble.“Certainly you differ,” she said, rather proudly. “I did not think of\ncomparing you: such power of persevering devoted labor as Mr.\nCasaubon’s is not common.”"

  "content": "Will saw that she was offended, but this only gave an additional\nimpulse to the new irritation of his latent dislike towards Mr.\nCasaubon. It was too intolerable that Dorothea should be worshipping\nthis husband: such weakness in a woman is pleasant to no man but the\nhusband in question. Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out\nof their neighbor’s buzzing glory, and think that such killing is no\nmurder.“No, indeed,” he answered, promptly. “And therefore it is a pity that\nit should be thrown away, as so much English scholarship is, for want\nof knowing what is being done by the rest of the world. If Mr. Casaubon\nread German he would save himself a great deal of trouble.”“I do not understand you,” said Dorothea, startled and anxious.“I merely mean,” said Will, in an offhand way, “that the Germans have\ntaken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which\nare got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have\nmade good roads. When I was with Mr. Casaubon I saw that he deafened\nhimself in that direction: it was almost against his will that he read\na Latin treatise written by a German. I was very sorry.”Will only thought of giving a good pinch that would annihilate that\nvaunted laboriousness, and was unable to imagine the mode in which\nDorothea would be wounded. Young Mr. Ladislaw was not at all deep\nhimself in German writers; but very little achievement is required in\norder to pity another man’s shortcomings.Poor Dorothea felt a pang at the thought that the labor of her\nhusband’s life might be void, which left her no energy to spare for the\nquestion whether this young relative who was so much obliged to him\nought not to have repressed his observation. She did not even speak,\nbut sat looking at her hands, absorbed in the piteousness of that\nthought.Will, however, having given that annihilating pinch, was rather\nashamed, imagining from Dorothea’s silence that he had offended her\nstill more; and having also a conscience about plucking the\ntail-feathers from a benefactor.“I regretted it especially,” he resumed, taking the usual course from\ndetraction to insincere eulogy, “because of my gratitude and respect\ntowards my cousin. It would not signify so much in a man whose talents\nand character were less distinguished.”"

The question how she had come to accept Mr.\nCasaubon—which he had dismissed when he first saw her by saying that\nshe must be disagreeable in spite of appearances—was not now to be\nanswered on any such short and easy method. Whatever else she might be,\nshe was not disagreeable. She was not coldly clever and indirectly\nsatirical, but adorably simple and full of feeling. She was an angel\nbeguiled. It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the\nmelodious fragments in which her heart and soul came forth so directly\nand ingenuously. The Aeolian harp again came into his mind.She must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage.\nAnd if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her off to his\nlair with his talons simply and without legal forms, it would have been\nan unavoidable feat of heroism to release her and fall at her feet. But\nhe was something more unmanageable than a dragon: he was a benefactor\nwith collective society at his back, and he was at that moment entering\nthe room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor, while\nDorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm and regret, and\nWill was looking animated with his admiring speculation about her\nfeelings."

  "content": "Mr. Casaubon felt a surprise which was quite unmixed with pleasure, but\nhe did not swerve from his usual politeness of greeting, when Will rose\nand explained his presence. Mr. Casaubon was less happy than usual, and\nthis perhaps made him look all the dimmer and more faded; else, the\neffect might easily have been produced by the contrast of his young\ncousin’s appearance. The first impression on seeing Will was one of\nsunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his changing\nexpression. Surely, his very features changed their form, his jaw\nlooked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in\nhis nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he turned his head\nquickly his hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought\nthey saw decided genius in this coruscation. Mr. Casaubon, on the\ncontrary, stood rayless.As Dorothea’s eyes were turned anxiously on her husband she was perhaps\nnot insensible to the contrast, but it was only mingled with other\ncauses in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf\nwhich was the first stirring of a pitying tenderness fed by the\nrealities of his lot and not by her own dreams. Yet it was a source of\ngreater freedom to her that Will was there; his young equality was\nagreeable, and also perhaps his openness to conviction. She felt an\nimmense need of some one to speak to, and she had never before seen any\none who seemed so quick and pliable, so likely to understand\neverything.Mr. Casaubon gravely hoped that Will was passing his time profitably as\nwell as pleasantly in Rome—had thought his intention was to remain in\nSouth Germany—but begged him to come and dine to-morrow, when he could\nconverse more at large: at present he was somewhat weary. Ladislaw\nunderstood, and accepting the invitation immediately took his leave.Dorothea’s eyes followed her husband anxiously, while he sank down\nwearily at the end of a sofa, and resting his elbow supported his head\nand looked on the floor. A little flushed, and with bright eyes, she\nseated herself beside him, and said—“Forgive me for speaking so hastily to you this morning. I was wrong. I\nfear I hurt you and made the day more burdensome.”“I am glad that you feel that, my dear,” said Mr. Casaubon. He spoke\nquietly and bowed his head a little, but there was still an uneasy\nfeeling in his eyes as he looked at her.“But you do forgive me?” said Dorothea, with a quick sob. In her need\nfor some manifestation of feeling she was ready to exaggerate her own\nfault. Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on its\nneck and kiss it?“My dear Dorothea—‘who with repentance is not satisfied, is not of\nheaven nor earth:’—you do not think me worthy to be banished by that\nsevere sentence,” said Mr. Casaubon, exerting himself to make a strong\nstatement, and also to smile faintly."

  "content": "Dorothea was silent, but a tear which had come up with the sob would\ninsist on falling.“You are excited, my dear. And I also am feeling some unpleasant\nconsequences of too much mental disturbance,” said Mr. Casaubon. In\nfact, he had it in his thought to tell her that she ought not to have\nreceived young Ladislaw in his absence: but he abstained, partly from\nthe sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the\nmoment of her penitent acknowledgment, partly because he wanted to\navoid further agitation of himself by speech, and partly because he was\ntoo proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so\nexhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in\nother directions. There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little\nfire: it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp\ndespondency of uneasy egoism.“I think it is time for us to dress,” he added, looking at his watch.\nThey both rose, and there was never any further allusion between them\nto what had passed on this day.But Dorothea remembered it to the last with the vividness with which we\nall remember epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies,\nor some new motive is born. Today she had begun to see that she had\nbeen under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from\nMr. Casaubon, and she had felt the waking of a presentiment that there\nmight be a sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on\nhis side as on her own.We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder\nto feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from\nthat stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she\nwould devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his\nstrength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is\nno longer reflection but feeling—an idea wrought back to the directness\nof sense, like the solidity of objects—that he had an equivalent centre\nof self, whence the lights and shadows must always fall with a certain\ndifference.CHAPTER XXII."

On the\ncontrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of drawing\nher husband into conversation and of deferentially listening to him\nthan she had ever observed in any one before. To be sure, the listeners\nabout Tipton were not highly gifted! Will talked a good deal himself,\nbut what he said was thrown in with such rapidity, and with such an\nunimportant air of saying something by the way, that it seemed a gay\nlittle chime after the great bell. If Will was not always perfect, this\nwas certainly one of his good days. He described touches of incident\namong the poor people in Rome, only to be seen by one who could move\nabout freely; he found himself in agreement with Mr. Casaubon as to the\nunsound opinions of Middleton concerning the relations of Judaism and\nCatholicism; and passed easily to a half-enthusiastic half-playful\npicture of the enjoyment he got out of the very miscellaneousness of\nRome, which made the mind flexible with constant comparison, and saved\nyou from seeing the world’s ages as a set of box-like partitions\nwithout vital connection. Mr. Casaubon’s studies, Will observed, had\nalways been of too broad a kind for that, and he had perhaps never felt\nany such sudden effect, but for himself he confessed that Rome had\ngiven him quite a new sense of history as a whole: the fragments\nstimulated his imagination and made him constructive. Then\noccasionally, but not too often, he appealed to Dorothea, and discussed\nwhat she said, as if her sentiment were an item to be considered in the\nfinal judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno or the Laocoon. A sense\nof contributing to form the world’s opinion makes conversation\nparticularly cheerful; and Mr. Casaubon too was not without his pride\nin his young wife, who spoke better than most women, as indeed he had\nperceived in choosing her."

  "content": "Since things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon’s statement that\nhis labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days, and\nthat after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying\nin Rome, encouraged Will to urge that Mrs. Casaubon should not go away\nwithout seeing a studio or two. Would not Mr. Casaubon take her? That\nsort of thing ought not to be missed: it was quite special: it was a\nform of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with its\npopulation of insects on huge fossils. Will would be happy to conduct\nthem—not to anything wearisome, only to a few examples.Mr. Casaubon, seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards him, could not but\nask her if she would be interested in such visits: he was now at her\nservice during the whole day; and it was agreed that Will should come\non the morrow and drive with them.Will could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom even Mr.\nCasaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced he led the way\nto the studio of his friend Adolf Naumann, whom he mentioned as one of\nthe chief renovators of Christian art, one of those who had not only\nrevived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as\nmysteries at which the successive ages were spectators, and in relation\nto which the great souls of all periods became as it were\ncontemporaries. Will added that he had made himself Naumann’s pupil for\nthe nonce.“I have been making some oil-sketches under him,” said Will. “I hate\ncopying. I must put something of my own in. Naumann has been painting\nthe Saints drawing the Car of the Church, and I have been making a\nsketch of Marlowe’s Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in his\nChariot. I am not so ecclesiastical as Naumann, and I sometimes twit\nhim with his excess of meaning. But this time I mean to outdo him in\nbreadth of intention. I take Tamburlaine in his chariot for the\ntremendous course of the world’s physical history lashing on the\nharnessed dynasties. In my opinion, that is a good mythical\ninterpretation.” Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who received this\noffhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and bowed with a neutral\nair.“The sketch must be very grand, if it conveys so much,” said Dorothea.\n“I should need some explanation even of the meaning you give. Do you\nintend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and volcanoes?”“Oh yes,” said Will, laughing, “and migrations of races and clearings\nof forests—and America and the steam-engine. Everything you can\nimagine!”"

He had a suspicion that he was\nbeing laughed at. But it was not possible to include Dorothea in the\nsuspicion.They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present;\nhis pictures were advantageously arranged, and his own plain vivacious\nperson set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so\nthat everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful\nyoung English lady exactly at that time.The painter in his confident English gave little dissertations on his\nfinished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as\nmuch as he did Dorothea. Will burst in here and there with ardent words\nof praise, marking out particular merits in his friend’s work; and\nDorothea felt that she was getting quite new notions as to the\nsignificance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones\nwith the simple country as a background, and of saints with\narchitectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in\ntheir skulls. Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were\ngathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was\napparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not\ninterested himself.“I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to\nread it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures\nsooner than yours with the very wide meaning,” said Dorothea, speaking\nto Will.“Don’t speak of my painting before Naumann,” said Will. “He will tell\nyou, it is all _pfuscherei_, which is his most opprobrious word!”“Is that true?” said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on Naumann, who\nmade a slight grimace and said—“Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting. His walk must be\n_belles-lettres_. That is wi-ide.”"

  "content": "Naumann’s pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word\nsatirically. Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr.\nCasaubon, while he felt some disgust at the artist’s German accent,\nbegan to entertain a little respect for his judicious severity.The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside\nfor a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr.\nCasaubon, came forward again and said—“My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a\nsketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas\nAquinas in my picture there. It is too much to ask; but I so seldom see\njust what I want—the idealistic in the real.”“You astonish me greatly, sir,” said Mr. Casaubon, his looks improved\nwith a glow of delight; “but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been\naccustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to\nyou in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel\nhonored. That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one;\nand if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.”As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it had\nbeen a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and\nworthiest among the sons of men. In that case her tottering faith would\nhave become firm again.Naumann’s apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the\nsketch went on at once as well as the conversation. Dorothea sat down\nand subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she had done for a\nlong while before. Every one about her seemed good, and she said to\nherself that Rome, if she had only been less ignorant, would have been\nfull of beauty: its sadness would have been winged with hope. No nature\ncould be less suspicious than hers: when she was a child she believed\nin the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows,\nand was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made\nmanifest.The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English\npolities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched\nhimself on some steps in the background overlooking all."

  "content": "Presently Naumann said—“Now if I could lay this by for half an hour and\ntake it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is perfect so far.”Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is\ntoo strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—“Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other engagements—I\ncould not ask it—or even to come again to-morrow.”“Oh, let us stay!” said Dorothea. “We have nothing to do to-day except\ngo about, have we?” she added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon.\n“It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible.”“I am at your service, sir, in the matter,” said Mr. Casaubon, with\npolite condescension. “Having given up the interior of my head to\nidleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.”“You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!” said Naumann, and then went\non in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he\nwere considering that. Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round\nvaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards\nturning to Mr. Casaubon, said—“Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling\nto let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of\nher—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single\nstudy.”Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him,\nand Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put myself?”Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to\nadjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected\nairs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when\nthe painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want you to\nstand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at that\nstool, please, so!”Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s feet\nand kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he\nwas adjusting her arm. All this was impudence and desecration, and he\nrepented that he had brought her."
