  "content": "Since things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon’s statement that\nhis labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days, and\nthat after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying\nin Rome, encouraged Will to urge that Mrs. Casaubon should not go away\nwithout seeing a studio or two. Would not Mr. Casaubon take her? That\nsort of thing ought not to be missed: it was quite special: it was a\nform of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with its\npopulation of insects on huge fossils. Will would be happy to conduct\nthem—not to anything wearisome, only to a few examples.Mr. Casaubon, seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards him, could not but\nask her if she would be interested in such visits: he was now at her\nservice during the whole day; and it was agreed that Will should come\non the morrow and drive with them.Will could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom even Mr.\nCasaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced he led the way\nto the studio of his friend Adolf Naumann, whom he mentioned as one of\nthe chief renovators of Christian art, one of those who had not only\nrevived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as\nmysteries at which the successive ages were spectators, and in relation\nto which the great souls of all periods became as it were\ncontemporaries. Will added that he had made himself Naumann’s pupil for\nthe nonce.“I have been making some oil-sketches under him,” said Will. “I hate\ncopying. I must put something of my own in. Naumann has been painting\nthe Saints drawing the Car of the Church, and I have been making a\nsketch of Marlowe’s Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in his\nChariot. I am not so ecclesiastical as Naumann, and I sometimes twit\nhim with his excess of meaning. But this time I mean to outdo him in\nbreadth of intention. I take Tamburlaine in his chariot for the\ntremendous course of the world’s physical history lashing on the\nharnessed dynasties. In my opinion, that is a good mythical\ninterpretation.” Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who received this\noffhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and bowed with a neutral\nair.“The sketch must be very grand, if it conveys so much,” said Dorothea.\n“I should need some explanation even of the meaning you give. Do you\nintend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and volcanoes?”“Oh yes,” said Will, laughing, “and migrations of races and clearings\nof forests—and America and the steam-engine. Everything you can\nimagine!”"

  "content": "“What a difficult kind of shorthand!” said Dorothea, smiling towards\nher husband. “It would require all your knowledge to be able to read\nit.”Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will. He had a suspicion that he was\nbeing laughed at. But it was not possible to include Dorothea in the\nsuspicion.They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present;\nhis pictures were advantageously arranged, and his own plain vivacious\nperson set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so\nthat everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful\nyoung English lady exactly at that time.The painter in his confident English gave little dissertations on his\nfinished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as\nmuch as he did Dorothea. Will burst in here and there with ardent words\nof praise, marking out particular merits in his friend’s work; and\nDorothea felt that she was getting quite new notions as to the\nsignificance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones\nwith the simple country as a background, and of saints with\narchitectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in\ntheir skulls. Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were\ngathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was\napparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not\ninterested himself.“I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to\nread it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures\nsooner than yours with the very wide meaning,” said Dorothea, speaking\nto Will.“Don’t speak of my painting before Naumann,” said Will. “He will tell\nyou, it is all _pfuscherei_, which is his most opprobrious word!”“Is that true?” said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on Naumann, who\nmade a slight grimace and said—“Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting. His walk must be\n_belles-lettres_. That is wi-ide.”"

  "content": "Naumann’s pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word\nsatirically. Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr.\nCasaubon, while he felt some disgust at the artist’s German accent,\nbegan to entertain a little respect for his judicious severity.The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside\nfor a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr.\nCasaubon, came forward again and said—“My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a\nsketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas\nAquinas in my picture there. It is too much to ask; but I so seldom see\njust what I want—the idealistic in the real.”“You astonish me greatly, sir,” said Mr. Casaubon, his looks improved\nwith a glow of delight; “but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been\naccustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to\nyou in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel\nhonored. That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one;\nand if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.”As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it had\nbeen a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and\nworthiest among the sons of men. In that case her tottering faith would\nhave become firm again.Naumann’s apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the\nsketch went on at once as well as the conversation. Dorothea sat down\nand subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she had done for a\nlong while before. Every one about her seemed good, and she said to\nherself that Rome, if she had only been less ignorant, would have been\nfull of beauty: its sadness would have been winged with hope. No nature\ncould be less suspicious than hers: when she was a child she believed\nin the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows,\nand was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made\nmanifest.The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English\npolities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched\nhimself on some steps in the background overlooking all."

  "content": "Presently Naumann said—“Now if I could lay this by for half an hour and\ntake it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is perfect so far.”Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is\ntoo strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—“Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other engagements—I\ncould not ask it—or even to come again to-morrow.”“Oh, let us stay!” said Dorothea. “We have nothing to do to-day except\ngo about, have we?” she added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon.\n“It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible.”“I am at your service, sir, in the matter,” said Mr. Casaubon, with\npolite condescension. “Having given up the interior of my head to\nidleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.”“You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!” said Naumann, and then went\non in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he\nwere considering that. Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round\nvaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards\nturning to Mr. Casaubon, said—“Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling\nto let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of\nher—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single\nstudy.”Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him,\nand Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put myself?”Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to\nadjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected\nairs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when\nthe painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want you to\nstand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at that\nstool, please, so!”Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s feet\nand kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he\nwas adjusting her arm. All this was impudence and desecration, and he\nrepented that he had brought her."

  "content": "The artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about and\noccupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he could; but he did not in the\nend prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear\nfrom his expressing a fear that Mrs. Casaubon would be tired. Naumann\ntook the hint and said—“Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife.”So Mr. Casaubon’s patience held out further, and when after all it\nturned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect\nif another sitting could be had, it was granted for the morrow. On the\nmorrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once. The result of all\nwas so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that he arranged for the\npurchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the\ndoctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented,\nbut listened to with more or less attention by an audience above. The\nSanta Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared\nhimself to be dissatisfied with—he could not, in conscience, engage to\nmake a worthy picture of it; so about the Santa Clara the arrangement\nwas conditional.I will not dwell on Naumann’s jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that\nevening, or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea’s charm, in all which Will\njoined, but with a difference. No sooner did Naumann mention any detail\nof Dorothea’s beauty, than Will got exasperated at his presumption:\nthere was grossness in his choice of the most ordinary words, and what\nbusiness had he to talk of her lips? She was not a woman to be spoken\nof as other women were. Will could not say just what he thought, but he\nbecame irritable. And yet, when after some resistance he had consented\nto take the Casaubons to his friend’s studio, he had been allured by\nthe gratification of his pride in being the person who could grant\nNaumann such an opportunity of studying her loveliness—or rather her\ndivineness, for the ordinary phrases which might apply to mere bodily\nprettiness were not applicable to her. (Certainly all Tipton and its\nneighborhood, as well as Dorothea herself, would have been surprised at\nher beauty being made so much of. In that part of the world Miss Brooke\nhad been only a “fine young woman.”)"

  "content": "“Oblige me by letting the subject drop, Naumann. Mrs. Casaubon is not\nto be talked of as if she were a model,” said Will. Naumann stared at\nhim.“Schön! I will talk of my Aquinas. The head is not a bad type, after\nall. I dare say the great scholastic himself would have been flattered\nto have his portrait asked for. Nothing like these starchy doctors for\nvanity! It was as I thought: he cared much less for her portrait than\nhis own.”“He’s a cursed white-blooded pedantic coxcomb,” said Will, with\ngnashing impetuosity. His obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not known to\nhis hearer, but Will himself was thinking of them, and wishing that he\ncould discharge them all by a check.Naumann gave a shrug and said, “It is good they go away soon, my dear.\nThey are spoiling your fine temper.”All Will’s hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing\nDorothea when she was alone. He only wanted her to take more emphatic\nnotice of him; he only wanted to be something more special in her\nremembrance than he could yet believe himself likely to be. He was\nrather impatient under that open ardent good-will, which he saw was her\nusual state of feeling. The remote worship of a woman throned out of\ntheir reach plays a great part in men’s lives, but in most cases the\nworshipper longs for some queenly recognition, some approving sign by\nwhich his soul’s sovereign may cheer him without descending from her\nhigh place. That was precisely what Will wanted. But there were plenty\nof contradictions in his imaginative demands. It was beautiful to see\nhow Dorothea’s eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to Mr.\nCasaubon: she would have lost some of her halo if she had been without\nthat duteous preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the husband’s\nsandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable; and Will’s longing\nto say damaging things about him was perhaps not the less tormenting\nbecause he felt the strongest reasons for restraining it."

  "content": "Will had not been invited to dine the next day. Hence he persuaded\nhimself that he was bound to call, and that the only eligible time was\nthe middle of the day, when Mr. Casaubon would not be at home.Dorothea, who had not been made aware that her former reception of Will\nhad displeased her husband, had no hesitation about seeing him,\nespecially as he might be come to pay a farewell visit. When he entered\nshe was looking at some cameos which she had been buying for Celia. She\ngreeted Will as if his visit were quite a matter of course, and said at\nonce, having a cameo bracelet in her hand—“I am so glad you are come. Perhaps you understand all about cameos,\nand can tell me if these are really good. I wished to have you with us\nin choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought there was not\ntime. He will finish his work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three\ndays. I have been uneasy about these cameos. Pray sit down and look at\nthem.”“I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great mistake about\nthese little Homeric bits: they are exquisitely neat. And the color is\nfine: it will just suit you.”“Oh, they are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion. You\nsaw her with me at Lowick: she is light-haired and very pretty—at least\nI think so. We were never so long away from each other in our lives\nbefore. She is a great pet and never was naughty in her life. I found\nout before I came away that she wanted me to buy her some cameos, and I\nshould be sorry for them not to be good—after their kind.” Dorothea\nadded the last words with a smile.“You seem not to care about cameos,” said Will, seating himself at some\ndistance from her, and observing her while she closed the cases.“No, frankly, I don’t think them a great object in life,” said\nDorothea.“I fear you are a heretic about art generally. How is that? I should\nhave expected you to be very sensitive to the beautiful everywhere.”"

  "content": "“I suppose I am dull about many things,” said Dorothea, simply. “I\nshould like to make life beautiful—I mean everybody’s life. And then\nall this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life\nand make it no better for the world, pains one. It spoils my enjoyment\nof anything when I am made to think that most people are shut out from\nit.”“I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,” said Will, impetuously. “You\nmight say the same of landscape, of poetry, of all refinement. If you\ncarried it out you ought to be miserable in your own goodness, and turn\nevil that you might have no advantage over others. The best piety is to\nenjoy—when you can. You are doing the most then to save the earth’s\ncharacter as an agreeable planet. And enjoyment radiates. It is of no\nuse to try and take care of all the world; that is being taken care of\nwhen you feel delight—in art or in anything else. Would you turn all\nthe youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and moralizing\nover misery? I suspect that you have some false belief in the virtues\nof misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.” Will had gone\nfurther than he intended, and checked himself. But Dorothea’s thought\nwas not taking just the same direction as his own, and she answered\nwithout any special emotion—“Indeed you mistake me. I am not a sad, melancholy creature. I am never\nunhappy long together. I am angry and naughty—not like Celia: I have a\ngreat outburst, and then all seems glorious again. I cannot help\nbelieving in glorious things in a blind sort of way. I should be quite\nwilling to enjoy the art here, but there is so much that I don’t know\nthe reason of—so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness\nrather than beauty. The painting and sculpture may be wonderful, but\nthe feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous.\nHere and there I see what takes me at once as noble—something that I\nmight compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian\nHill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the\nbest kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.”“Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer things\nwant that soil to grow in.”"

  "content": "“Oh dear,” said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current\nof her anxiety; “I see it must be very difficult to do anything good. I\nhave often felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives would\nlook much uglier and more bungling than the pictures, if they could be\nput on the wall.”Dorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more, but\nchanged her mind and paused.“You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such thoughts,”\nsaid Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head habitual to\nhim. “You talk as if you had never known any youth. It is monstrous—as\nif you had had a vision of Hades in your childhood, like the boy in the\nlegend. You have been brought up in some of those horrible notions that\nchoose the sweetest women to devour—like Minotaurs. And now you will go\nand be shut up in that stone prison at Lowick: you will be buried\nalive. It makes me savage to think of it! I would rather never have\nseen you than think of you with such a prospect.”Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach\nto words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so\nmuch kindness in it for Dorothea’s heart, which had always been giving\nout ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings\naround her, that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a\ngentle smile—“It is very good of you to be anxious about me. It is because you did\nnot like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another kind of\nlife. But Lowick is my chosen home.”The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will\ndid not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him to\nembrace her slippers, and tell her that he would die for her: it was\nclear that she required nothing of the sort; and they were both silent\nfor a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at\nlast what had been in her mind beforehand.“I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other day.\nPerhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that\nyou like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak\nhastily.”"

  "content": "“What was it?” said Will, observing that she spoke with a timidity\nquite new in her. “I have a hyperbolical tongue: it catches fire as it\ngoes. I dare say I shall have to retract.”“I mean what you said about the necessity of knowing German—I mean, for\nthe subjects that Mr. Casaubon is engaged in. I have been thinking\nabout it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon’s learning he must\nhave before him the same materials as German scholars—has he not?”\nDorothea’s timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she was\nin the strange situation of consulting a third person about the\nadequacy of Mr. Casaubon’s learning.“Not exactly the same materials,” said Will, thinking that he would be\nduly reserved. “He is not an Orientalist, you know. He does not profess\nto have more than second-hand knowledge there.”“But there are very valuable books about antiquities which were written\na long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern\nthings; and they are still used. Why should Mr. Casaubon’s not be\nvaluable, like theirs?” said Dorothea, with more remonstrant energy.\nShe was impelled to have the argument aloud, which she had been having\nin her own mind.“That depends on the line of study taken,” said Will, also getting a\ntone of rejoinder. “The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing\nas chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making new points of view.\nWho wants a system on the basis of the four elements, or a book to\nrefute Paracelsus? Do you not see that it is no use now to be crawling\na little way after men of the last century—men like Bryant—and\ncorrecting their mistakes?—living in a lumber-room and furbishing up\nbroken-legged theories about Chus and Mizraim?”"

  "content": "“How can you bear to speak so lightly?” said Dorothea, with a look\nbetween sorrow and anger. “If it were as you say, what could be sadder\nthan so much ardent labor all in vain? I wonder it does not affect you\nmore painfully, if you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so\nmuch goodness, power, and learning, should in any way fail in what has\nbeen the labor of his best years.” She was beginning to be shocked that\nshe had got to such a point of supposition, and indignant with Will for\nhaving led her to it.“You questioned me about the matter of fact, not of feeling,” said\nWill. “But if you wish to punish me for the fact, I submit. I am not in\na position to express my feeling toward Mr. Casaubon: it would be at\nbest a pensioner’s eulogy.”“Pray excuse me,” said Dorothea, coloring deeply. “I am aware, as you\nsay, that I am in fault in having introduced the subject. Indeed, I am\nwrong altogether. Failure after long perseverance is much grander than\nnever to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.”“I quite agree with you,” said Will, determined to change the\nsituation—“so much so that I have made up my mind not to run that risk\nof never attaining a failure. Mr. Casaubon’s generosity has perhaps\nbeen dangerous to me, and I mean to renounce the liberty it has given\nme. I mean to go back to England shortly and work my own way—depend on\nnobody else than myself.”“That is fine—I respect that feeling,” said Dorothea, with returning\nkindness. “But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything\nin the matter except what was most for your welfare.”“She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now she\nhas married him,” said Will to himself. Aloud he said, rising—“I shall not see you again.”“Oh, stay till Mr. Casaubon comes,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “I am so\nglad we met in Rome. I wanted to know you.”“And I have made you angry,” said Will. “I have made you think ill of\nme.”“Oh no. My sister tells me I am always angry with people who do not say\njust what I like. But I hope I am not given to think ill of them. In\nthe end I am usually obliged to think ill of myself for being so\nimpatient.”“Still, you don’t like me; I have made myself an unpleasant thought to\nyou.”“Not at all,” said Dorothea, with the most open kindness. “I like you\nvery much.”Will was not quite contented, thinking that he would apparently have\nbeen of more importance if he had been disliked. He said nothing, but\nlooked dull, not to say sulky."

  "content": "“And I am quite interested to see what you will do,” Dorothea went on\ncheerfully. “I believe devoutly in a natural difference of vocation. If\nit were not for that belief, I suppose I should be very narrow—there\nare so many things, besides painting, that I am quite ignorant of. You\nwould hardly believe how little I have taken in of music and\nliterature, which you know so much of. I wonder what your vocation will\nturn out to be: perhaps you will be a poet?”“That depends. To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern that\nno shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel, that discernment\nis but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of\nemotion—a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling,\nand feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge. One may have that\ncondition by fits only.”“But you leave out the poems,” said Dorothea. “I think they are wanted\nto complete the poet. I understand what you mean about knowledge\npassing into feeling, for that seems to be just what I experience. But\nI am sure I could never produce a poem.”“You _are_ a poem—and that is to be the best part of a poet—what makes\nup the poet’s consciousness in his best moods,” said Will, showing such\noriginality as we all share with the morning and the spring-time and\nother endless renewals.“I am very glad to hear it,” said Dorothea, laughing out her words in a\nbird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful gratitude in her\neyes. “What very kind things you say to me!”“I wish I could ever do anything that would be what you call kind—that\nI could ever be of the slightest service to you. I fear I shall never\nhave the opportunity.” Will spoke with fervor.“Oh yes,” said Dorothea, cordially. “It will come; and I shall remember\nhow well you wish me. I quite hoped that we should be friends when I\nfirst saw you—because of your relationship to Mr. Casaubon.” There was\na certain liquid brightness in her eyes, and Will was conscious that\nhis own were obeying a law of nature and filling too. The allusion to\nMr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that moment could\nhave spoiled the subduing power, the sweet dignity, of her noble\nunsuspicious inexperience."

  "content": "“And there is one thing even now that you can do,” said Dorothea,\nrising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring\nimpulse. “Promise me that you will not again, to any one, speak of that\nsubject—I mean about Mr. Casaubon’s writings—I mean in that kind of\nway. It was I who led to it. It was my fault. But promise me.”She had returned from her brief pacing and stood opposite Will, looking\ngravely at him.“Certainly, I will promise you,” said Will, reddening however. If he\nnever said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off\nreceiving favors from him, it would clearly be permissible to hate him\nthe more. The poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and Will was at\nleast ready with that accomplishment. He said that he must go now\nwithout waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom he would come to take leave of\nat the last moment. Dorothea gave him her hand, and they exchanged a\nsimple “Good-by.”But going out of the _porte cochere_ he met Mr. Casaubon, and that\ngentleman, expressing the best wishes for his cousin, politely waived\nthe pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow, which would be\nsufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure.“I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I\nthink will heighten your opinion of him,” said Dorothea to her husband\nin the course of the evening. She had mentioned immediately on his\nentering that Will had just gone away, and would come again, but Mr.\nCasaubon had said, “I met him outside, and we made our final adieux, I\nbelieve,” saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any\nsubject, whether private or public, does not interest us enough to wish\nfor a further remark upon it. So Dorothea had waited.“What is that, my love?” said Mr Casaubon (he always said “my love”\nwhen his manner was the coldest).“He has made up his mind to leave off wandering at once, and to give up\nhis dependence on your generosity. He means soon to go back to England,\nand work his own way. I thought you would consider that a good sign,”\nsaid Dorothea, with an appealing look into her husband’s neutral face.“Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would\naddict himself?”"

  "content": "Fred Vincy, we have seen, had a debt on his mind, and though no such\nimmaterial burthen could depress that buoyant-hearted young gentleman\nfor many hours together, there were circumstances connected with this\ndebt which made the thought of it unusually importunate. The creditor\nwas Mr. Bambridge, a horse-dealer of the neighborhood, whose company\nwas much sought in Middlemarch by young men understood to be “addicted\nto pleasure.” During the vacations Fred had naturally required more\namusements than he had ready money for, and Mr. Bambridge had been\naccommodating enough not only to trust him for the hire of horses and\nthe accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a\nsmall advance by which he might be able to meet some losses at\nbilliards. The total debt was a hundred and sixty pounds. Bambridge was\nin no alarm about his money, being sure that young Vincy had backers;\nbut he had required something to show for it, and Fred had at first\ngiven a bill with his own signature. Three months later he had renewed\nthis bill with the signature of Caleb Garth. On both occasions Fred had\nfelt confident that he should meet the bill himself, having ample funds\nat disposal in his own hopefulness. You will hardly demand that his\nconfidence should have a basis in external facts; such confidence, we\nknow, is something less coarse and materialistic: it is a comfortable\ndisposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of providence or the\nfolly of our friends, the mysteries of luck or the still greater\nmystery of our high individual value in the universe, will bring about\nagreeable issues, such as are consistent with our good taste in\ncostume, and our general preference for the best style of thing. Fred\nfelt sure that he should have a present from his uncle, that he should\nhave a run of luck, that by dint of “swapping” he should gradually\nmetamorphose a horse worth forty pounds into a horse that would fetch a\nhundred at any moment—“judgment” being always equivalent to an\nunspecified sum in hard cash. And in any case, even supposing negations\nwhich only a morbid distrust could imagine, Fred had always (at that\ntime) his father’s pocket as a last resource, so that his assets of\nhopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about them. Of what\nmight be the capacity of his father’s pocket, Fred had only a vague\nnotion: was not trade elastic? And would not the deficiencies of one\nyear be made up for by the surplus of another? The Vincys lived in an\neasy profuse way, not with any new ostentation, but according to the\nfamily habits and traditions, so that the children had no standard of\neconomy, and the elder ones retained some of their infantine notion\nthat their father might pay for anything if he would. Mr. Vincy himself\nhad expensive Middlemarch habits—spent money on coursing, on his\ncellar, and on dinner-giving, while mamma had those running accounts\nwith tradespeople, which give a cheerful sense of getting everything\none wants without any question of payment. But it was in the nature of\nfathers, Fred knew, to bully one about expenses: there was always a\nlittle storm over his extravagance if he had to disclose a debt, and\nFred disliked bad weather within doors. He was too filial to be\ndisrespectful to his father, and he bore the thunder with the certainty\nthat it was transient; but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see\nhis mother cry, and also to be obliged to look sulky instead of having\nfun; for Fred was so good-tempered that if he looked glum under\nscolding, it was chiefly for propriety’s sake. The easier course\nplainly, was to renew the bill with a friend’s signature. Why not? With\nthe superfluous securities of hope at his command, there was no reason\nwhy he should not have increased other people’s liabilities to any\nextent, but for the fact that men whose names were good for anything\nwere usually pessimists, indisposed to believe that the universal order\nof things would necessarily be agreeable to an agreeable young\ngentleman."

Still there is always a certain number who are dismissed\nas but moderately eager until the others have refused; and it happened\nthat Fred checked off all his friends but one, on the ground that\napplying to them would be disagreeable; being implicitly convinced that\nhe at least (whatever might be maintained about mankind generally) had\na right to be free from anything disagreeable. That he should ever fall\ninto a thoroughly unpleasant position—wear trousers shrunk with\nwashing, eat cold mutton, have to walk for want of a horse, or to “duck\nunder” in any sort of way—was an absurdity irreconcilable with those\ncheerful intuitions implanted in him by nature. And Fred winced under\nthe idea of being looked down upon as wanting funds for small debts.\nThus it came to pass that the friend whom he chose to apply to was at\nonce the poorest and the kindest—namely, Caleb Garth."

  "content": "The Garths were very fond of Fred, as he was of them; for when he and\nRosamond were little ones, and the Garths were better off, the slight\nconnection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone’s double\nmarriage (the first to Mr. Garth’s sister, and the second to Mrs.\nVincy’s) had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the\nchildren rather than the parents: the children drank tea together out\nof their toy teacups, and spent whole days together in play. Mary was a\nlittle hoyden, and Fred at six years old thought her the nicest girl in\nthe world, making her his wife with a brass ring which he had cut from\nan umbrella. Through all the stages of his education he had kept his\naffection for the Garths, and his habit of going to their house as a\nsecond home, though any intercourse between them and the elders of his\nfamily had long ceased. Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous, the\nVincys were on condescending terms with him and his wife, for there\nwere nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch; and though old\nmanufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none but\nequals, they were conscious of an inherent social superiority which was\ndefined with great nicety in practice, though hardly expressible\ntheoretically. Since then Mr. Garth had failed in the building\nbusiness, which he had unfortunately added to his other avocations of\nsurveyor, valuer, and agent, had conducted that business for a time\nentirely for the benefit of his assignees, and had been living\nnarrowly, exerting himself to the utmost that he might after all pay\ntwenty shillings in the pound. He had now achieved this, and from all\nwho did not think it a bad precedent, his honorable exertions had won\nhim due esteem; but in no part of the world is genteel visiting founded\non esteem, in the absence of suitable furniture and complete\ndinner-service. Mrs. Vincy had never been at her ease with Mrs. Garth,\nand frequently spoke of her as a woman who had had to work for her\nbread—meaning that Mrs. Garth had been a teacher before her marriage;\nin which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall’s Questions\nwas something like a draper’s discrimination of calico trademarks, or a\ncourier’s acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better\noff needed that sort of thing. And since Mary had been keeping Mr.\nFeatherstone’s house, Mrs. Vincy’s want of liking for the Garths had\nbeen converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred should\nengage himself to this plain girl, whose parents “lived in such a small\nway.” Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home of his visits to\nMrs. Garth, which had of late become more frequent, the increasing\nardor of his affection for Mary inclining him the more towards those\nwho belonged to her."

He obtained it without much difficulty, for a large amount\nof painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth cautious\nabout his own affairs, or distrustful of his fellow-men when they had\nnot proved themselves untrustworthy; and he had the highest opinion of\nFred, was “sure the lad would turn out well—an open affectionate\nfellow, with a good bottom to his character—you might trust him for\nanything.” Such was Caleb’s psychological argument. He was one of those\nrare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others. He had a\ncertain shame about his neighbors’ errors, and never spoke of them\nwillingly; hence he was not likely to divert his mind from the best\nmode of hardening timber and other ingenious devices in order to\npreconceive those errors. If he had to blame any one, it was necessary\nfor him to move all the papers within his reach, or describe various\ndiagrams with his stick, or make calculations with the odd money in his\npocket, before he could begin; and he would rather do other men’s work\nthan find fault with their doing. I fear he was a bad disciplinarian."

Accordingly, he took the paper\nand lowered his spectacles, measured the space at his command, reached\nhis pen and examined it, dipped it in the ink and examined it again,\nthen pushed the paper a little way from him, lifted up his spectacles\nagain, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy\neyebrows, which gave his face a peculiar mildness (pardon these details\nfor once—you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb\nGarth), and said in a comfortable tone,—“It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse’s knees? And then,\nthese exchanges, they don’t answer when you have ’cute jockeys to deal\nwith. You’ll be wiser another time, my boy.”Whereupon Caleb drew down his spectacles, and proceeded to write his\nsignature with the care which he always gave to that performance; for\nwhatever he did in the way of business he did well. He contemplated the\nlarge well-proportioned letters and final flourish, with his head a\ntrifle on one side for an instant, then handed it to Fred, said\n“Good-by,” and returned forthwith to his absorption in a plan for Sir\nJames Chettam’s new farm-buildings.Either because his interest in this work thrust the incident of the\nsignature from his memory, or for some reason of which Caleb was more\nconscious, Mrs. Garth remained ignorant of the affair."

  "content": "Since it occurred, a change had come over Fred’s sky, which altered his\nview of the distance, and was the reason why his uncle Featherstone’s\npresent of money was of importance enough to make his color come and\ngo, first with a too definite expectation, and afterwards with a\nproportionate disappointment. His failure in passing his examination,\nhad made his accumulation of college debts the more unpardonable by his\nfather, and there had been an unprecedented storm at home. Mr. Vincy\nhad sworn that if he had anything more of that sort to put up with,\nFred should turn out and get his living how he could; and he had never\nyet quite recovered his good-humored tone to his son, who had\nespecially enraged him by saying at this stage of things that he did\nnot want to be a clergyman, and would rather not “go on with that.”\nFred was conscious that he would have been yet more severely dealt with\nif his family as well as himself had not secretly regarded him as Mr.\nFeatherstone’s heir; that old gentleman’s pride in him, and apparent\nfondness for him, serving in the stead of more exemplary conduct—just\nas when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act\nkleptomania, speak of it with a philosophical smile, and never think of\nhis being sent to the house of correction as if he were a ragged boy\nwho had stolen turnips. In fact, tacit expectations of what would be\ndone for him by uncle Featherstone determined the angle at which most\npeople viewed Fred Vincy in Middlemarch; and in his own consciousness,\nwhat uncle Featherstone would do for him in an emergency, or what he\nwould do simply as an incorporated luck, formed always an immeasurable\ndepth of aerial perspective. But that present of bank-notes, once made,\nwas measurable, and being applied to the amount of the debt, showed a\ndeficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred’s “judgment” or\nby luck in some other shape. For that little episode of the alleged\nborrowing, in which he had made his father the agent in getting the\nBulstrode certificate, was a new reason against going to his father for\nmoney towards meeting his actual debt. Fred was keen enough to foresee\nthat anger would confuse distinctions, and that his denial of having\nborrowed expressly on the strength of his uncle’s will would be taken\nas a falsehood. He had gone to his father and told him one vexatious\naffair, and he had left another untold: in such cases the complete\nrevelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity. Now\nFred piqued himself on keeping clear of lies, and even fibs; he often\nshrugged his shoulders and made a significant grimace at what he called\nRosamond’s fibs (it is only brothers who can associate such ideas with\na lovely girl); and rather than incur the accusation of falsehood he\nwould even incur some trouble and self-restraint. It was under strong\ninward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken the wise step of\ndepositing the eighty pounds with his mother. It was a pity that he had\nnot at once given them to Mr. Garth; but he meant to make the sum\ncomplete with another sixty, and with a view to this, he had kept\ntwenty pounds in his own pocket as a sort of seed-corn, which, planted\nby judgment, and watered by luck, might yield more than threefold—a\nvery poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young gentleman’s\ninfinite soul, with all the numerals at command."

Hopefulness has a pleasure\nin making a throw of any kind, because the prospect of success is\ncertain; and only a more generous pleasure in offering as many as\npossible a share in the stake. Fred liked play, especially billiards,\nas he liked hunting or riding a steeple-chase; and he only liked it the\nbetter because he wanted money and hoped to win. But the twenty pounds’\nworth of seed-corn had been planted in vain in the seductive green\nplot—all of it at least which had not been dispersed by the\nroadside—and Fred found himself close upon the term of payment with no\nmoney at command beyond the eighty pounds which he had deposited with\nhis mother. The broken-winded horse which he rode represented a present\nwhich had been made to him a long while ago by his uncle Featherstone:\nhis father always allowed him to keep a horse, Mr. Vincy’s own habits\nmaking him regard this as a reasonable demand even for a son who was\nrather exasperating. This horse, then, was Fred’s property, and in his\nanxiety to meet the imminent bill he determined to sacrifice a\npossession without which life would certainly be worth little. He made\nthe resolution with a sense of heroism—heroism forced on him by the\ndread of breaking his word to Mr. Garth, by his love for Mary and awe\nof her opinion. He would start for Houndsley horse-fair which was to be\nheld the next morning, and—simply sell his horse, bringing back the\nmoney by coach?—Well, the horse would hardly fetch more than thirty\npounds, and there was no knowing what might happen; it would be folly\nto balk himself of luck beforehand. It was a hundred to one that some\ngood chance would fall in his way; the longer he thought of it, the\nless possible it seemed that he should not have a good chance, and the\nless reasonable that he should not equip himself with the powder and\nshot for bringing it down. He would ride to Houndsley with Bambridge\nand with Horrock “the vet,” and without asking them anything expressly,\nhe should virtually get the benefit of their opinion. Before he set\nout, Fred got the eighty pounds from his mother."

  "content": "Most of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company with\nBambridge and Horrock, on his way of course to Houndsley horse-fair,\nthought that young Vincy was pleasure-seeking as usual; and but for an\nunwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand, he himself would have\nhad a sense of dissipation, and of doing what might be expected of a\ngay young fellow. Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that he\nrather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not\nbeen to the university, and that he had written stanzas as pastoral and\nunvoluptuous as his flute-playing, his attraction towards Bambridge and\nHorrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh\nwould not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of\nNaming which determinates so much of mortal choice. Under any other\nname than “pleasure” the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock\nmust certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with\nthem at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion\nin a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished with a\ndirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an anonymous horse\nin a stable, His Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat, and\nvarious leaden spittoons, might have seemed a hard business, but for\nthe sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit\nof these things was “gay.”"
