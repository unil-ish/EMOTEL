Down ye go.’“‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against\nit; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down\ninto their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.“As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain\nand his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide\nof the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called\nfor the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the\ncompanionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered\nsomething down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten\nin number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had\nremained neutral.“All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and\naft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at\nwhich last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\nbreaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed\nin peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the\npumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary\nnight dismally resounded through the ship."

Water was\nthen lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were\ntossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,\nthe Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three\ndays this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,\nand then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;\nand suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were\nready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,\nunited perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained\nthem to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a\nterrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he\nbelonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up\ninto the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain\nthem. Only three were left.“‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.“‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.“‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.“It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\nseven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had\nlast hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as\nblack as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to\nthe two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst\nout of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with\ntheir keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a\nhandle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if\nby any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For\nhimself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.\nThat was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met\nwith no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were\nready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a\nsurrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first\nman on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this\ntheir leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;\nparticularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,\nin the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder\nwould but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play\nof these miscreants must come out."

But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead\nthem to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of\nvillany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their\nleader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in\nthree sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with\ncords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.“Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\nand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a\nfew minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\nstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\nallies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been\nfully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along\nthe deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the\nmizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till\nmorning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\n‘the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’“At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\nrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\nformer that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the\nwhole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the\npresent, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with\na reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.“‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the\nrigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and, seizing\na rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\ntraitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\nsideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.“‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still\nrope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take\nthat gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\ncramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a\nsort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I\nmurder you!’“‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with\nthe rope to strike.“‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman."

Ever\nsince the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\ntumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the\nwhole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly\nspeak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\nwhat the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced\nto his pinioned foe.“‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.“‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,\nwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing\nno more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that\nmight have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were\nturned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps\nclanged as before."

  "content": "“Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\nwas heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\nbesieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\nEntreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\ninstance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no\nsign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\nthat mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\nship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\nspeediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,\nnot to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\nspite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\nfor a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\nberth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\nvital jaw of the whale.“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\nall was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\nman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney\nthe chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\nthan half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he\ninsisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the\nhead of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\ncircumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\nthe boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In\nthis attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\nthis was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\nnext trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning\nof the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\nin his watches below.“‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.“‘What do you think? what does it look like?’“‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’“‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length\nbefore him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough\ntwine,—have you any?’“But there was none in the forecastle.“‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.“‘You don’t mean to go a begging to _him!_’ said a sailor."

Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help\nhimself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him\nquietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\nhim—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an\niron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\nLakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock\nfor a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\nhelm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\ndug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the\nfore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and\nstretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.“But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\ndeed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\navenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\nto take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\ndone.“It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\nday, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe\nman, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There\nshe rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.“‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do\nwhales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’“‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but\nthat would be too long a story.’“‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.“‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more\ninto the air, Sirs.’“‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks\nfaint;—fill up his empty glass!’"

All was now a phrensy.\n‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and\nharpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to\ncapture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed\naskance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,\nthat lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a\nliving opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality\npervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out\nbefore the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of\nthe mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\nwhile Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or\nslacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\nwere lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely\nwith delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\nstiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\nsprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.\nAnd now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.\nNothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\nfoam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat\nstruck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the\nstanding mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,\nthe boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was\ntossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\nout through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\nveil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But\nthe whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\nbetween his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,\nand went down."

But a sudden, terrific,\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\ncut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose\nagain, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the\nteeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the\nwhale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary\nplace—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\namong the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\nwar-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\nupon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\ndown the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over\ntheir dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both\nby night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,\nthat upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a\nweakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so\nheavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the\nship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon\nfrom the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\nIslanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with\nhim, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\nbefore the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\nreinforcement to his crew."

He steered away from\nit; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of\nSteelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The\ncaptain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked\nwar-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the\npistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and\nfoam.“‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.“‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;\n‘no lies.’“‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he\nleaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,\nstood face to face with the captain.“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As\nsoon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder\nisland, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike\nme!’“‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping\ninto the sea, he swam back to his comrades.“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\nroots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\ntime arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck\nbefriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were\nprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor\nheaded. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former\ncaptain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.“Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,\nand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized\nTahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small\nnative schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all\nright there, again resumed his cruisings.“Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\nNantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to\ngive up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\ndestroyed him.  * * * *“‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.“‘I am, Don.’“‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,\nthis your story is in substance really true?

Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\nsomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\neye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\nalongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\nIt may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious\nimaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\nconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\nworld right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\nwrong."

  "content": "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\nbe found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\never since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\npanellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\nmedallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\nchain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever\nsince then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\nonly in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\npresentations of him.Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\nto be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\nElephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless\nsculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,\nevery conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of\nthem actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our\nnoble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The\nHindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\ndepicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly\nknown as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small\nsection of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an\nanaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes."

It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing\nAndromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model\nof such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the\nsame scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better.\nThe huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the\nsurface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on\nits back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\nrolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames\nby water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old\nScotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depicted in the prints of old\nBibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for\nthe book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a\ndescending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of\nmany books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely\nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on\nantique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless\ncall this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\nintended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an\nold Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\nRevival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a\ncomparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a\nspecies of the Leviathan.In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you\nwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all\nmanner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and\nBaden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the\ntitle-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you\nwill find some curious whales.But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\npictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\nby those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some\nplates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\nentitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\nWhale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the\nwhales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among\nice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another\nplate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\nperpendicular flukes.Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain\nColnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round\nCape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the\nSpermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to\nbe a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from\none killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”\nI doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the\nbenefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say\nthat it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,\nto a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a\nbow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not\ngive us Jonah looking out of that eye!"

Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In\nthe abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\n“whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this\nunsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the\nnarwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\nany intelligent public of schoolboys.Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great\nnaturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\nseveral pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\nare not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\nwhale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\nexperienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\ncounterpart in nature.But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\nreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\nBaron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\ngives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\npicture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\nretreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is\nnot a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\na whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\npicture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\nin the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\nis, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the\npencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.As for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the\nshops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\nRichard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;\nbreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of\nmariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue\npaint."

  "content": "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\nsurprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have\nbeen taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\ndrawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\nthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\nThough elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living\nLeviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The\nliving whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen\nat sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out\nof sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element\nit is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily\ninto the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.\nAnd, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour\nbetween a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;\nyet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a\nship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying\nshape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not\ncatch.But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\nwhale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at\nall. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,\nthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though\nJeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of\none of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed\nutilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal\ncharacteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any\nleviathan’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully\ninvested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\nroundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the\nhead, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is\nalso very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which\nalmost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the\nthumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,\nand little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy\ncovering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However\nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one\nday, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”"

  "content": "For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\nconclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world\nwhich must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the\nmark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\nconsiderable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\nout precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\nwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by\ngoing a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\nbeing eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you\nhad best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\nLeviathan.CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True\nPictures of Whaling Scenes.In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them\nwhich are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,\nespecially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass\nthat matter by.I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\nColnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous\nchapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far\nbetter than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All\nBeale’s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in\nthe picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second\nchapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no\ndoubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is\nadmirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\nSperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;\nbut they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\nare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\nbut one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,\nbecause it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you\ncan derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by\nhis living hunters."

  "content": "But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\nnot the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be\nanywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and\ntaken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent\nattacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble\nSperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath\nthe boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the\nair upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\nthe boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\nmonster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\nincomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\nincensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if\nfrom a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\ntrue. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\npoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the\nswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\nof affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing\ndown upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical\ndetails of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I\ncould not draw so good a one.In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\nthe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his\nblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the\nPatagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so\nthat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there\nmust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are\npecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and\nmaccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent\nback. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\nthe deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and\ncausing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh\nthe paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all\nraging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the\nglassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the\npowerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered\nfortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole\ninserted into his spout-hole.Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he\nwas either practically conversant with his subject, or else\nmarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the\nlads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,\nand where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing\ncommotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the\nbeholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great\nbattles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern\nLights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\ncharge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that\ngallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery."

  "content": "The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\nthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\nthey have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s\nexperience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\nAmericans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\nfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the\nwhale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale\ndraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical\noutline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so\nfar as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\nsketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned\nRight whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland\nwhale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and\nporpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,\nchopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a\nLeuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six\nfac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement\nto the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so\nimportant a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured\nfor every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of\nthe Peace.In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\nFrench engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself\n“H. Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present\npurpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet\nnoon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,\ninshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened\nsails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,\nboth drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,\nwhen considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen\nunder one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving\nis quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in\nthe very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;\nthe vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to\na quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,\nis about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and\nlances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in\nits hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands\nhalf-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the\nsmoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke\nover a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up\nwith earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the\nexcited seamen.CHAPTER 57.

  "content": "On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a\ncrippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted\nboard before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his\nleg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats\n(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is\nbeing crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten\nyears, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited\nthat stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification\nhas now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever\npublished in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a\nstump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for\never mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman\nmake; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own\namputation.Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag\nHarbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm\nWhale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and\nother like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous\nlittle ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough\nmaterial, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little\nboxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their\njack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,\nthey will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner’s\nfancy.Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man\nto that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called\nsavagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I\nmyself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the\nCannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic\nhours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian\nwar-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of\ncarving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.\nFor, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that\nmiraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has\ncost steady years of steady application.As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the\nsame marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of\nhis one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not\nquite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as\nthe Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\nsuggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert\nDurer."
