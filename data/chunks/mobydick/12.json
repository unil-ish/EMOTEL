  "content": "On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a\ncrippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted\nboard before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his\nleg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats\n(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is\nbeing crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten\nyears, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited\nthat stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification\nhas now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever\npublished in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a\nstump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for\never mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman\nmake; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own\namputation.Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag\nHarbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm\nWhale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and\nother like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous\nlittle ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough\nmaterial, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little\nboxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their\njack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,\nthey will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner’s\nfancy.Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man\nto that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called\nsavagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I\nmyself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the\nCannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic\nhours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian\nwar-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of\ncarving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.\nFor, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that\nmiraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has\ncost steady years of steady application.As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the\nsame marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of\nhis one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not\nquite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as\nthe Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\nsuggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert\nDurer."

Some of them are done with much\naccuracy.At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung\nby the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is\nsleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales\nare seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some\nold-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for\nweather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all\nintents and purposes so labelled with “_Hands off!_” you cannot examine\nthem closely enough to decide upon their merit.In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken\ncliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,\nyou will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the\nLeviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against\nthem in a surf of green surges.Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is\ncontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from\nsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the\nprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be\na thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you\nwish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the\nexact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,\nelse so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your\nprecise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;\nlike the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once\nhigh-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them."

Thus at the North have I chased\nLeviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright\npoints that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent\nAntarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase\nagainst the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and\nthe Flying Fish.With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for\nspurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to\nsee whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really\nlie encamped beyond my mortal sight!CHAPTER 58. Brit.Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows\nof brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale\nlargely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that\nwe seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden\nwheat.On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from\nthe attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly\nswam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that\nwondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated\nfrom the water that escaped at the lip.As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their\nscythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these\nmonsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving\nbehind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.**That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does\nnot bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there\nbeing shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable\nmeadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually\nfloating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased."

Seen from the mast-heads, especially when\nthey paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms\nlooked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in\nthe great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will\nsometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them\nto be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;\neven so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species\nof the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their\nimmense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such\nbulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with\nthe same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the\ndeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though\nsome old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are\nof their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the\nthing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for\nexample, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to\nthe sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any\ngeneric respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas\nhave ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and\nrepelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,\nso that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his\none superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of\nall mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen\ntens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;\nthough but a moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man\nmay brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering\nfuture, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,\nto the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize\nthe stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the\ncontinual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense\nof the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese\nvengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.\nThat same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships\nof last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided;\ntwo thirds of the fair world it yet covers."

Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,\nwhen under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and\nswallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in\nprecisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it\nis also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who\nmurdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath\nspawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her\nown cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the\nrocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of\nships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting\nlike a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean\noverruns the globe.Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures\nglide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously\nhidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish\nbrilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the\ndainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once\nmore, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey\nupon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile\nearth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a\nstrange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean\nsurrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one\ninsular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the\nhorrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that\nisle, thou canst never return!CHAPTER 59. Squid.Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her\nway north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling\nher keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering\nmasts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a\nplain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,\nalluring jet would be seen."

Thus glistening\nfor a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,\nand silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?\nthought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once\nmore, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,\nthe negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches! right\nahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the\nbees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on\nthe bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave\nhis orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction\nindicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had\ngradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the\nideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular\nwhale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed\nhim; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly\nperceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave\norders for lowering."

Soon it went down, and while, with\noars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot\nwhere it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the\nmoment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous\nphenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A\nvast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing\ncream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms\nradiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of\nanacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.\nNo perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of\neither sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an\nunearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still\ngazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice\nexclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to\nhave seen thee, thou white ghost!”“What was it, Sir?” said Flask.“The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,\nand returned to their ports to tell of it.”But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;\nthe rest as silently following.Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected\nwith the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it\nbeing so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with\nportentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them\ndeclare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few\nof them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature\nand form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm\nwhale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food\nabove water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the\nspermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the\nsurface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,\nprecisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will\ndisgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some\nof them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They\nfancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings\nby them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other\nspecies, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it."

  "content": "There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop\nPontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in\nwhich the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with\nsome other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But\nmuch abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he\nassigns it.By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious\ncreature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of\ncuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would\nseem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.CHAPTER 60. The Line.With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as\nfor the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,\nI have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\nvapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\nropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable\nto the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to\nthe sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary\nquantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which\nit must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in\ngeneral by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however\nmuch it may give it compactness and gloss.Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\nentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not\nso durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and\nI will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much more\nhandsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark\nfellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\nto behold."

  "content": "The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\nsight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\nits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\ntwenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\nto three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures\nsomething over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is\nspirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still\nthough, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely\nbedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any\nhollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of\nthe cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in\nrunning out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,\nthe utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some\nharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,\ncarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\nblock towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\npossible wrinkles and twists.In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\nbeing continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in\nthis; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into\nthe boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,\nnearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a\nrather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in\nthickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which\nwill bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a\nconcentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the\nAmerican line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\nprodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\neye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\ntub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\nThis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:\nIn order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\nneighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to\nthreaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\nharpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug\nof ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first\nboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This\narrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for were the\nlower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the\nwhale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking\nminute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed\nboat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\nthe sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again."

  "content": "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\ntaken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\nagain carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise\nupon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his\nwrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately\nsit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\nextreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size\nof a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it\nhangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the\nboat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\ncoiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale\nstill a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp—the\nrope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to\nthat connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too\ntedious to detail.Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\ntwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\noarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\neye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest\nsnakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal\nwoman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,\nand while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any\nunknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\ncontortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones\nto quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what\ncannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,\nand brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you\nwill hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus\nhung in hangman’s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before\nKing Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of\ndeath, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those\nrepeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of\nthis man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.\nFor, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is\nlike being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a\nsteam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and\nwheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in\nthe heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,\nand you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest\nwarning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and\nsimultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a\nMazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could\nnever pierce you out."

But why say more? All men\nlive enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their\nnecks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,\nthat mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\nAnd if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would\nnot at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before\nyour evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to\nQueequeg it was quite a different object.“When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the\nbow of his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special\nto engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of\nsleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean\nthrough which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively\nground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,\nflying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than\nthose off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\nleaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed\nin what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in\nthat dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of\nmy body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,\nlong after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the\nseamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that\nat last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every\nswing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering\nhelmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the\nwide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all."

And lo! close under our lee, not\nforty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like\nthe capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian\nhue, glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating\nin the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his\nvapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of\na warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck\nby some enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all\nat once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from\nall parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from\naloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and\nregularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.“Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he\ndashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and\nere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the\nleeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples\nas he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,\nAhab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak\nbut in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the\nboats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of\nthe noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,\nthe monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,\nand then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.“There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by\nStubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite\nwas granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the\nwhale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat, and\nmuch nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the\nhonor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length\nbecome aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore\nno longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.\nAnd still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the\nassault.Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,\nhe was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad\nyeast which he brewed.*"

  "content": "*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the\nentire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though\napparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about\nhim. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does\nso when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the\nupper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water\nformation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he\nthereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish\ngalliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.“Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of\ntime—but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried\nStubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em\nthe long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start\nher, all; but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is the word—easy,\neasy—only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the\nburied dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys—that’s all. Start\nher!”“Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old\nwar-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat\ninvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke\nwhich the eager Indian gave.But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee!\nKee-hee!” yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,\nlike a pacing tiger in his cage."

Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still\nencouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from\nhis mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the\nwelcome cry was heard—“Stand up, Tashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon\nwas hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed water; the same moment\nsomething went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was\nthe magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two\nadditional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its\nincreased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and\nmingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round\nand round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it\nblisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb’s hands, from\nwhich the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at\nthese times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy’s\nsharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time\nstriving to wrest it out of your clutch.“Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\nit.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\nThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\nStubb and Tashtego here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering\nbusiness truly in that rocking commotion.*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\nstated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\nrunning line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or\nbailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most\nconvenient.From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part\nof the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you\nwould have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the\nother the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at\nonce. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy\nin her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a\nlittle finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic\ngunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main\nclinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall\nform of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order\nto bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics\nseemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale\nsomewhat slackened his flight.“Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while\nyet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,\nfirmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart\ninto the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately\nsterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then\nranging up for another fling."

His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which\nbubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun\nplaying upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection\ninto every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.\nAnd all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot\nfrom the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the\nmouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his\ncrooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again\nand again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and\nagain sent it into the whale.“Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale\nrelaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along\nthe fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned\nhis long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully\nchurning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold\nwatch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of\nbreaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was\nthe innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting\nfrom his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the\nmonster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in\nimpenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,\ninstantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from\nthat phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into\nview; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting\nhis spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,\ngush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees\nof red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran\ndripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!“He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.“Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,\nStubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood\nthoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.CHAPTER 62.

  "content": "According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes\noff from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary\nsteersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost\noar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,\nnervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what\nis called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the\ndistance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting\nthe chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the\nuttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\nactivity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated\nloud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the\ntop of one’s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half\nstarted—what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I\ncannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same\ntime. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the\nfish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting\ncry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his\noar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the\ncrotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it\nsomehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen\nin a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are\nsuccessful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed\nand disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\nblood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are\nabsent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship\nowners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that\nmakes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\nyou expect to find it there when most wanted!Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\nthat is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\nlikewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\nthemselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the\nheadsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper\nstation in the bows of the boat.Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both\nfoolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from\nfirst to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no\nrowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances\nobvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a\nslight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various\nwhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast\nmajority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\nharpooneer that has caused them.To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this\nworld must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out\nof toil.CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in\nproductive subjects, grow the chapters.The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.\nIt is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,\nwhich is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the\nbow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of\nthe harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the\nprow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who\nsnatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his\nrifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in\nthe crotch, respectively called the first and second irons."

  "content": "But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\nthe line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\ninstantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the\ncoming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It\nis a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to\nthe instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon\nreceiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,\nhowever lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into\nhim. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the\nline, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,\nbe anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else\nthe most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the\nwater, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line\n(mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances,\nprudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended\nwith the saddest and most fatal casualties.Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\noverboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,\nskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,\nor cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.\nNor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is\nfairly captured and a corpse.Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging\none unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these\nqualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\nsuch an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\nsimultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is\nsupplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first\none be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are\nfaithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several\nmost important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be\npainted.CHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a\ncalm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\nbusiness of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen\nmen with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and\nfingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse\nin the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long\nintervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of\nthe mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever\nthey call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will\ndraw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this\ngrand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead\nin bulk."

  "content": "Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly\neyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for\nsecuring it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,\nwent his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until\nmorning.Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the\ncreature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or\ndespair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\nreminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand\nother whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot\nadvance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought\nfrom the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to\ncast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the\ndeck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking\nlinks, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by\nthe head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies\nwith its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness\nof the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship\nand whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one\nreclines while the other remains standing.*"

  "content": "*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,\nis by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is\nrelatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\nflexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;\nso that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to\nput the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a\nsmall, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,\nand a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.\nBy adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\nof the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\nmade to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last\nlocked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of\njunction with its broad flukes or lobes.If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known\non deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an\nunusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was\nhe in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned\nto him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping\ncause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely\nmanifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of\nthe whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.“A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut\nme one from his small!”Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general\nthing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray\nthe current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds\nof the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers\nwho have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale\ndesignated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body."
