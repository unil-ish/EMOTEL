Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”“Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if\nhe ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man,\nlimping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,\nlike Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so\noutlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\nphilosophy of it.It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\nWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\nprices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the\ncourt obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\neaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\nwhale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\nmeat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being\nwell seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\nThe old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\nporpoise grant from the crown."

  "content": "The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\nhands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\nwhen you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\nlong, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\nlike Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\nnot so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\nold vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\ndoctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\njuicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\nlong ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that\nthese men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\nwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\nthe Dutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed,\nthey greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\nlike old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.\nThey have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can\nhardly keep his hands off.But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\nexceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\ndelicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the\nbuffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\npyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\nis; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\nthird month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\nbutter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\nsome other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches\nof the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\nship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many\na good supper have I thus made.In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine\ndish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two\nplump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large\npuddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most\ndelectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head, which is\nquite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young\nbucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves’ brains, by\nand by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to\ntell a calf’s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires\nuncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with\nan intelligent looking calf’s head before him, is somehow one of the\nsaddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at\nhim, with an “Et tu Brute!” expression."

  "content": "It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with\nabhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration\nbefore mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing\nof the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man\nthat ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was\nhung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would\nhave been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\nmeat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds\nstaring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight\ntake a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a\ncannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that\nsalted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it\nwill be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of\njudgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who\nnailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\npaté-de-foie-gras.But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is\nadding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is\nthat handle made of?—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox\nyou are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring\nthat fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill\ndid the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to\nGanders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month\nor two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but\nsteel pens.CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and\nweary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general\nthing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting\nhim in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very\nsoon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the\ncommon usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send\nevery one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation\nthat, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and\ntwo for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck\nto see that all goes well."

  "content": "But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will\nnot answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather\nround the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a\nstretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In\nmost other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so\nlargely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\ndiminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a\nprocedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to\ntickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the\npresent case with the Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man\nunaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,\nwould have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and\nthose sharks the maggots in it.Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\nconcluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came\non deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for\nimmediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering\nthree lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid\nsea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an\nincessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep\ninto their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy\nconfusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not\nalways hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the\nincredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at\neach other’s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and\nbit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again\nby the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was\nthis all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these\ncreatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in\ntheir very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual\nlife had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,\none of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried\nto shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;\nis about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,\ncorresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its\nsides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than\nthe lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when\nbeing used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a\nstiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle."

  "content": "In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous\nthings comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and\nwhich no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was\nswayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the\nstrongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end of the\nhawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted\nto the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over\nthe whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one\nhundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the\nside, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,\nbegan cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just\nabove the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,\nsemicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the\nmain body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving\nin one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship\ncareens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads\nof an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her\nfrighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the\nwhale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\nhelping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap\nis heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from\nthe whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it\nthe disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as\nthe blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,\nso is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes\nstripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the\nwindlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the\nwater, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the\nline called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck\nand Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and\nindeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher\nand higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the\nwindlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious\nblood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and\nevery one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else\nit may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard."

  "content": "One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon\ncalled a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices\nout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into\nthis hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then\nhooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for\nwhat follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands\nto stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a\nfew sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in\ntwain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper\nstrip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for\nlowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one\ntackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\nis slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the\nmain hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the\nblubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep\ncoiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of\nplaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting\nand lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the\nheavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates\nscarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by\nway of assuaging the general friction.CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin\nof the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced\nwhalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion\nremains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you\nknow what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence\nof firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and\nranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness."

  "content": "Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\ncreature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet\nin point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;\nbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\nwhale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer\nof any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?\nTrue, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with\nyour hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat\nresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as\nflexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it\nnot only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I\nhave several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.\nIt is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed\npage, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a\nmagnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales\nthrough their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at\nhere is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I\nadmit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be\nregarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to\nspeak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of\nthe tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a\nnew-born child. But no more of this.Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,\nas in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\nhundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,\nor rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three\nfourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence\nbe had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose\nmere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten\nbarrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three\nquarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin."

  "content": "In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among\nthe many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over\nobliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in\nthick array, something like those in the finest Italian line\nengravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the\nisinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as\nif they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some\ninstances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.\nThese are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers\non the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to\nuse in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the\nhieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck\nwith a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the\nfamous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.\nLike those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains\nundecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another\nthing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm\nWhale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially\nhis flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by\nreason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random\naspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,\nwhich Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact\nwith vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a\nlittle resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me\nthat such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact\nwith other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\nfull-grown bulls of the species.A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the\nwhale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\npieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very\nhappy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber\nas in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho\nslipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of\nthis cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep\nhimself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.\nWhat would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy\nseas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other\nfish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but\nthese, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very\nbellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the\nlee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn\nfire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his\nblood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after\nexplanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as\nindispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at\nhome, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when\nseamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is\nfound glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been\nproved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than\nthat of a Borneo negro in summer."

There are other ghosts than\nthe Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe\nin them.CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping\nthe body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the\nSperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced\nwhale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;\non the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that\nvery place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the\nsurgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening\nbetween him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a\ndiscoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear\nin mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut\nmany feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without\nso much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus\nmade, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,\nand exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion\ninto the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he\ndemanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a\ncable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small\nwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a\nfull grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head\nembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend\nsuch a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this\nwere as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’\nscales."

O Nature, and O soul of man!\nhow far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the\nsmallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate\nin mind.”CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than\nthe ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.By and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads\nproved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and\nshooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the\nPequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what\nresponse would be made.Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships\nof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which\nsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respective\nvessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale\ncommanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at\nconsiderable distances and with no small facility."

It turned out that the\nJeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her\ncaptain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though\nhimself and boat’s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was\nhalf a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and\nflowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine\nof the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with\nthe Pequod.But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an\ninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s\nboat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to\nthe Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it\nblew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times\nby the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed\nsome way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper\nbearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now\nand then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at\nintervals not without still another interruption of a very different\nsort.Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual\nnotabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish\nman, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant\nyellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut\ntinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on\nhis wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\nexclaimed—“That’s he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the\nTown-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story\ntold of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time\nprevious when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account\nand what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in\nquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\nJeroboam. His story was this:"

A strange,\napostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,\nwhere, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,\ncommon-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate\nfor the Jeroboam’s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway\nupon the ship’s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in\na freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded\nthe captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he\nset himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\nvicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which\nhe declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,\nexcited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real\ndelirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of\nthe ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they\nwere afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical\nuse in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\npleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\napprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first\nconvenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and\nvials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in\ncase this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his\ndisciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the\ncaptain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of\nthem would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor\nwould they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he\nwould; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of\nthe ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared\nlittle or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had\nbroken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the\nplague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be\nstayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor\ndevils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to\nhis instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.\nSuch things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.\nNor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the\nmeasureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\npower of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to\nreturn to the Pequod."

Beware of the horrible\nplague!”“Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that\ninstant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings\ndrowned all speech.“Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted\nback.“Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the\nhorrible tail!”“I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as if\ndragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a\nsuccession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional\ncaprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the\nhoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was\nseen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\nnature seemed to warrant.When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\nconcerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from\nGabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed\nleagued with him."

  "content": "It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking\na whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of\nMoby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this\nintelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the\nWhite Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering\ninsanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the\nShaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some\nyear or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the\nmast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;\nand the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the\nopportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations and\nforewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.\nWith them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many\nperilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron\nfast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was\ntossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of\nspeedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while\nMacey, the mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the\nreckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\nwhale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a\nbroad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,\ntemporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next\ninstant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\ninto the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea\nat the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was\nharmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\noftener the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the\nheadsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But\nstrangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,\nwhen the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is\ndiscernible; the man being stark dead.The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly\ndescried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”\nGabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of\nthe whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added\ninfluence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\nspecifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\nprophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one\nof many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror\nto the ship.Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,\nthat the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\nintended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which\nAhab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to\nhis feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\ndownward pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down\nthere!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just\nbethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy\nofficers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”"

It was sorely\ntumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in\nconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a\nletter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.“Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but\na dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a\nlong cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to\ninsert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without\nits coming any closer to the ship.Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a\nwoman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey,\nShip Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”“Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let\nme have it.”“Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going\nthat way.”“Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to\nreceive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he\ncaught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\nboat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;\nthe boat drifted a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by\nmagic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He\nclutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the\nletter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s\nfeet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\noars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the\nPequod.As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket\nof the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild\naffair.CHAPTER 72.

  "content": "In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,\nthere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands\nare wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no\nstaying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has\nto be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the\ndescription of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was\nmentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the\nblubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the\nspades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that\nsame hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\nparticular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to\ndescend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.\nBut in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall\nremain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is\nconcluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,\nexcepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten\nfeet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,\nhalf on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like\na tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured\nin the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at\nleast, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better\nchance to observe him, as will presently be seen.Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\nin his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\nattend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\nwhale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\na long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg\ndown there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\nmonkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\nwaist.It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\nends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\nleather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,\nwere wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both\nusage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should\ndrag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature\nunited us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I\nany way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\nentailed."

Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of\ninterregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have\nso gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked\nhim now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\nto jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\nmine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\nmost cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a\nplurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\napothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,\nyou may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these\nand the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I\ncame very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do\nwhat I would, I only had the management of one end of it.**The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\nthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This\nimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man\nthan Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest\npossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his\nmonkey-rope holder.I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the\nwhale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant\nrolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy\nhe was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\nnight, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\npent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures\nswarmed round it like bees in a beehive.And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\naside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it\nnot that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\nmiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man."
