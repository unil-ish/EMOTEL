  "content": "In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for\ntwo or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\nattend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\nSperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;\nif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,\nthen I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of\nsmell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at\nall answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so\nclogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power\nof smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water\nor whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\non this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no\nproper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no\nviolets, no Cologne-water in the sea.Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\ncanal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished\nwith a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\nair or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\nunless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he\ntalks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\nSeldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\nworld, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\nliving. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!"

  "content": "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\nfor the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\nhorizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\nto one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\nin a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\nthis gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout\nof the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether\nthat exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\nindirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\nproved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\nspiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\nwhen in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s\nfood is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\nwould. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\nwatch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\nrhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\nrespiration.But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\nYou have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\ntell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\nsettle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\nknottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand\nin it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\nit; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\nwhen, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\nof his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all\naround him. And if at such times you should think that you really\nperceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\nnot merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are\nnot those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\nfissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For\neven when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\nhis elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then,\nthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\nblazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\nrain."

  "content": "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\nprecise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\ninto it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\nthis fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\nslight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will\noften happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\nthe thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\ncontact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or\notherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\nWherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\nevade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\nit, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind\nyou. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is\nto let this deadly spout alone.Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\nhypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\nother reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\ntouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I\naccount him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\nfact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\nwhales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\nconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\nPlato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\nup a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\nthoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\ncuriosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected\nthere, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over\nmy head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep\nthought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an\nAugust noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\nsupposition.And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\nbehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\nhead overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable\ncontemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified\nby a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.\nFor, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate\nvapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my\nmind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a\nheavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\nbut doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of\nall things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this\ncombination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who\nregards them both with equal eye.CHAPTER 86. The Tail."

  "content": "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\nand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,\nI celebrate a tail.Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point\nof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\nupon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.\nThe compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat\npalms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in\nthickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,\nthen sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy\nbetween. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely\ndefined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost\nexpansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\ntwenty feet across.The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\ninto it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,\nmiddle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long\nand horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\ncrosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\nanything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\nwalls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\ncourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\nrelics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\ngreat strength of the masonry.But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\nthe whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\nmuscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\nand running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\nlargely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\nmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\nCould annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it."

  "content": "Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\nflexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a\nTitanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most\nappalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or\nharmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly\nbeautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied\ntendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\nHercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the\nlinen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with\nthe massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.\nWhen Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what\nrobustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in\nthe Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which\nhis idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so\ndestitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but\nthe mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on\nall hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his\nteachings.Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\nwielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\nbe in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein\nno fairy’s arm can transcend it.Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\nFourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\nwriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\nwhale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\nforwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\nthis which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster\nwhen furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\nconflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\nstriking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\nblow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\nair, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\nirresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\nsalvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\nopposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\nwhale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a\ndashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the\nmost serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received\nin the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one\nstrips off a frock, and the hole is stopped."

  "content": "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\nthe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\nthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\nelephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\nsweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\nthe sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,\nwhiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\nHad this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\nDarmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\nsalutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\nzones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\npossess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\nanother elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\ntrunk and extracted the dart.Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\nmiddle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\nof his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\nhearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\ntail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\nthunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\ngreat gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of\nvapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\nthat was the smoke from the touch-hole."

  "content": "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\nlie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\nout of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\nthe deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\ntossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\ndownwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere\nelse to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the\ngrandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\nprofundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\nhighest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting\nforth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\ngazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the\nDantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\narchangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\ncrimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\nall heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\npeaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\nof adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\nthe fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\nelephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\ndevout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\nelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\nuplifted in the profoundest silence.The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\nelephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\nof the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite\norgans on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\nrespectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\nLeviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the\nstalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were\nas the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\ncrash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated\ninstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\noars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his\nballs.**Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and\nthe elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\nelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does\nto the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of\ncurious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the\nelephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then\nelevating it, jet it forth in a stream."

At times there are gestures in it, which,\nthough they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly\ninexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are\nthese mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them\nakin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these\nmethods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting\nother motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,\nand unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I\nmay, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I\nknow not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much\nmore, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my\nback parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.\nBut I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will\nabout his face, I say again he has no face.CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from\nthe territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.\nIn a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of\nSumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast\nmole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and\ndividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded\noriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports\nfor the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are\nthe straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,\nvessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing\nmidway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green\npromontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond\nto the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and\nconsidering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,\nand gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental\nsea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such\ntreasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the\nappearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping\nwestern world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with\nthose domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\nMediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these\nOrientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from\nthe endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries\npast, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra\nand Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while\nthey freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce\ntheir claim to more solid tribute."

  "content": "Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the\nlow shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the\nvessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the\npoint of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they\nhave received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these\ncorsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present\nday, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in\nthose waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these\nstraits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and\nthence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here\nand there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands,\nand gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season\nthere. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost\nall the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to\ndescending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere\nelse foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby\nDick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he\nmight most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his\ncrew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,\nnow, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs\nno sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the\nwhaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be\ntransferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries\nno cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a\nwhole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with\nutilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She\ncarries years’ water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,\nwhen three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to\ndrink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,\nfrom the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other\nships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at\na score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have\nsighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating\nseamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that\nanother flood had come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the\nark!”"

  "content": "Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of\nJava, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of\nthe ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\nexcellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and\nmore upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and\nadmonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the\nland soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the\nfresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\ndescried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the\ncustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle\nof singular magnificence saluted us.But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with\nwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm\nWhales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached\ncompanies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive\nherds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost\nseem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and\ncovenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of\nthe Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now\nsometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by\na single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems\nthousands on thousands.Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\nforming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a\ncontinuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\nnoon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\nWhale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the\ncleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of\nthe Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually\nrising and falling away to leeward.Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of\nthe sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the\nair, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed\nlike the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried\nof a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height."

If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that\nchased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy\ninto the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\nnumber. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby\nDick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped\nwhite-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\nstun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly\ndirecting attention to something in our wake.Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our\nrear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling\nsomething like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so\ncompletely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally\ndisappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved\nin his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to\nwet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”"

As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in\nhis forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one\nthe bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above\nseemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery\ndefile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that\nthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that\nthrough that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his\ndeadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates\nand inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with\ntheir curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,\nAhab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after\nsome stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the\nfirm thing from its place.But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\nwhen, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\nPequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\nside, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\nharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been\ngaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake\nof the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the\nship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to\nspring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed\nwonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three\nkeels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than\nthey rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that\ntheir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved\non with redoubled velocity."

In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,\nand aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\nspoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was\nstill more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely\nparalysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled\nships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple\nsheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not\npossibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\ntimidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though\nbanding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the\nWest have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human\nbeings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,\nthey will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the\noutlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each\nother to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the\nstrangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts\nof the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\nyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\nretreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\nthose cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\nwhale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,\nQueequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\nin our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered\nstraight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part\nof the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise\nunprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;\nyet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the\nfishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the\nfrantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a\ndelirious throb.As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\nspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\nthus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\nthe crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\nlike a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\nthrough their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\nmoment it may be locked in and crushed."

Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their\nwonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to\nthe shouting part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried\none, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\nand for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,\nthere!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\ncalmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\nby the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of\nequal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\nother’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\nattached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\nbeing looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is\nchiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more\nwhales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But\nsperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you\nmust kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you\nmust wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.\nHence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into\nrequisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and\nsecond were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly\nrunning off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing\ndrugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But\nupon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy\nwooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an\ninstant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\nboat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea\ncame in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and\nshirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time."

  "content": "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it\nnot that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly\ndiminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\nthe circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So\nthat when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale\nsideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\nmomentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\nshoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\nvalley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost\nwhales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea\npresented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by\nthe subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.\nYes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the\nheart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we\nbeheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive\npods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,\nlike multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\nshoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\nmiddle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the\ndensity of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding\nthe embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at\npresent afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that\nhemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us\nup. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by\nsmall tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\nouter circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\nany one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\nthe whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\nmiles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be\ndeceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\nplaying up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\ncircumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely\nlocked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd\nhad hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\nstopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\ninnocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\nwhales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\nlake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\nbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like\nhousehold dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,\nand touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\ndomesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\ntheir backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\ntime refrained from darting it."

For, suspended\nin those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\nwhales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\nmothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\nexceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will\ncalmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two\ndifferent lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,\nbe still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so\ndid the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at\nus, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\nFloating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One\nof these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\nday old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six\nfeet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed\nscarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately\noccupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready\nfor the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.\nThe delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly\nretained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived\nfrom foreign parts.“Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him\nfast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”“What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.“Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\nof fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\nshows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\ntowards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord\nof Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to\nits dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this\nnatural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the\nhempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest\nsecrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We\nsaw young Leviathan amours in the deep.**The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\nunlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\ngestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\none at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\nEsau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\ncuriously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\nthemselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious\nparts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s\npouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk\nis very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well\nwith strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales\nsalute _more hominum_."

But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\nmy being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;\nand while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down\nand deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\nspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\nstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\npossibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\nof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\nof the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\nacross the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\nsometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\nand alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or\nmaiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A\nwhale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\neffectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying\nalong with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony\nof the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\nlone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\ndismay wherever he went.But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\nspectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\nto inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first\nthe intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived\nthat by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale\nhad become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run\naway with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope\nattached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\nharpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose\nfrom his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\nthrough the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\ntossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\ncomrades."

  "content": "This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\nstationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\nbegan to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by\nhalf spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\nheave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\nin more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\ncircles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\ndeparting. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\ntumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\ncentre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly\nStarbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your\noars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,\nyou Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,\nand stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape\nthem!—scrape away!”The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a\nnarrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate\nendeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way\nrapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.\nAfter many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into\nwhat had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random\nwhales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was\ncheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in\nthe bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his\nhead by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad\nflukes close by.Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\nresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\nclumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\nonward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;\nbut the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\nwhales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask\nhad killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of\nwhich are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at\nhand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both\nto mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,\nshould the boats of any other ship draw near."

The rest contrived to escape for\nthe time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some\nother craft than the Pequod.CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\nWhales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\nvast aggregations.Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\nhave been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\noccasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.\nSuch bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those\ncomposed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young\nvigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\nmale of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\nhis gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\nladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\nover the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\nendearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his\nconcubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\nleviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more\nthan one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\ncomparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\nyards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\nwhole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_."

You meet them on the Line in time for the\nfull flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,\nperhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating\nsummer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have\nlounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for\nthe Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so\nevade the other excessive temperature of the year.When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\nsuspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\ninteresting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\ncoming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\nladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\nhim away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are\nto be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do\nwhat the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of\nhis bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often\ncause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with\nthe whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They\nfence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and\nso striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their\nantlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these\nencounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some\ninstances, wrenched and dislocated mouths."
