Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!”But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards\nthe helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.“East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.“Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at this\nhour in the morning, and the sun astern?”Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then\nobserved by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very\nblinding palpableness must have been the cause.Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse\nof the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost\nseemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two\ncompasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the\nold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened\nbefore. Mr. Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s\nall. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”“Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,\ngloomily.Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than\none case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as\ndeveloped in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one\nwith the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much\nmarvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning\nhas actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars\nand rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more\nfatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before\nmagnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle.\nBut in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the\noriginal virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be\naffected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;\neven were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson."

  "content": "Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\ncompasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took\nthe precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were\nexactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be\nchanged accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod\nthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair\none had only been juggling her.Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said\nnothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and\nFlask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his\nfeelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some\nof them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear\nof Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost\nwholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain\nmagnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But\nchancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper\nsight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.“Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked\nthee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But\nAhab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without\na pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles.\nQuick!”Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about\nto do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to\nrevive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a\nmatter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old\nman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\npracticable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious\nsailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.“Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him\nthe things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s\nneedles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own,\nthat will point as true as any.”Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as\nthis was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic\nmight follow. But Starbuck looked away."

  "content": "With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the\nlance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade\nhim hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the\nmaul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he\nplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly\nhammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.\nThen going through some small strange motions with it—whether\nindispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to\naugment the awe of the crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread;\nand moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,\nand horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of\nthe compass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering\nand vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when\nAhab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly\nback from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,\nexclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level\nloadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!”One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could\npersuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk\naway.In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his\nfatal pride.CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log\nand line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance\nupon other means of determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen,\nand many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave\nthe log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake\nthan anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the\ncourse steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of\nprogression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden\nreel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the\nrailing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and\nwind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that\nhung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he\nhappened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet\nscene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his\nfrantic oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing\nplungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.“Forward, there! Heave the log!”Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.\n“Take the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where the\ndeck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into\nthe creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\nhandle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so\nstood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to\nhim."

  "content": "Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty\nturns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old\nManxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to\nspeak.“Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have\nspoiled it.”“’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?\nThou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”“I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey\nhairs of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a\nsuperior, who’ll ne’er confess.”“What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s\ngranite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert\nthou born?”“In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”“Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”“I know not, sir, but I was born there.”“In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man\nfrom Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;\nwhich is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall\nbutts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.”The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long\ndragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In\nturn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing\nresistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.“Hold hard!”Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the\ntugging log was gone.“I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad\nsea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;\nreel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and\nmend thou the line. See to it.”“There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer\nseems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,\nTahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and\ndragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”"

I think we had best have a\nnew line altogether. I’ll see Mr. Stubb about it.”CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.Steering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her progress\nsolely determined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod held on her\npath towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such\nunfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways\nimpelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all\nthese seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and\ndesperate scene.At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before\nthe dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then\nheaded by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\nunearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod’s\nmurdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their reveries,\nand for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all\ntransfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild\ncry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the\ncrew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers\nremained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman—the oldest mariner of\nall—declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the\nvoices of newly drowned men in the sea.Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he\ncame to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not\nunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus\nexplained the wonder."

  "content": "Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great\nnumbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or\nsome dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and\nkept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of\nwail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most\nmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not\nonly from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the\nhuman look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen\npeeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain\ncircumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At\nsun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;\nand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for\nsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus\nwith the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had\nnot been long at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry and a\nrushing—and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and\nlooking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the\nsea.The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern, where it\nalways hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,\nand the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it\nslowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and\nthe studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to\nyield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out\nfor the White Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar ground; that man\nwas swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the\ntime. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at\nleast as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of\nevil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.\nThey declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they\nhad heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay."

Dost thou hear me? Rig it.”“And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a hammer.“Aye.”“And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a\ncaulking-iron.“Aye.”“And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his hand\nas with a pitch-pot.“Away! what possesses thee to this?

And now I’m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s like\nturning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I\ndon’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it at all; it’s\nundignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we\nare their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,\nfair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\nthe beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at\nthe conclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at an end in the middle,\nand at the beginning at the end. It’s the old woman’s tricks to be\ngiving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for\ntinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a\nbald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would work\nfor lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\nVineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run\noff with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\nme see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with\npitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over\nthe ship’s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some\nsuperstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere\nthey would do the job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I\ndon’t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard\ntray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and\ncard-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or\nby the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore\nof our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it\nif we can. Hem! I’ll do the job, now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s\nsee—how many in the ship’s company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any\nway, I’ll have me thirty separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three\nfeet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,\nthere’ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight\nnot seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron,\npitch-pot, and marling-spike!

After a keen sail before the wind, this\nfourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in\nfastening—at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell\nanything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;\nand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing\nmore; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have\nindefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was\nsome apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals\nwere placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her\nthree far to windward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the\nprecisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been necessitated to\nleave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to\nincrease her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last\nsafe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail—after the\nmissing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every\nother man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a\nsufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when\nlast seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all\naround her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again\npaused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing\ntill daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been\nseen.The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his\nobject in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his\nown in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\napart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.“I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one\nin that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his\nwatch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two\npious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height\nof the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks—pale in\nthe very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been\nthe—”“My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I\nconjure”—here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had\nbut icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me\ncharter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if\nthere be no other way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you\nmust, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.”“His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the\ncoat and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”“He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx\nsailor standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”"

  "content": "Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s\nthe more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the\nCaptain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among\nthe number of the other boat’s crews, at the same time, but on the\nother hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the\nchase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the\nwretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;\nwhich was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively\nadopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,\nthat is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to\npick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown\nconstitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\ntill forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet\nmissing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\nearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had\nthus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\nvocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\ntender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage\nin some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a\nwhaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a\nfather’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and\nconcern.Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;\nand Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without\nthe least quivering of his own.“I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say _aye_ to me. Do to me\nas you would have me do to you in the like case. For _you_ too have a\nboy, Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a\nchild of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men,\nnow, and stand by to square in the yards.”“Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that\nprolongingly moulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.\nEven now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I\nforgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle\nwatch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all\nstrangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.”Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,\nleaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter\nrejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,\nGardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his\nboat, and returned to his ship.Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\nwas in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\nhowever small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung\nround; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat\nagainst a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the\nwhile, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three\ntall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly\nsaw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without\ncomfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were\nnot.CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.(_Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow._)"

The Hat.And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a\npreliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have\nchased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;\nnow, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude\nwhere his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had\nbeen spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered\nMoby Dick;—and now that all his successive meetings with various ships\ncontrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which\nthe white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;\nnow it was that there lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which\nit was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting\npolar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months’ night\nsustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now\nfixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It\ndomineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,\nfears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a\nsingle spear or leaf.In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\nvanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more\nstrove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed\nground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped\nmortar of Ahab’s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the\ndeck, ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was on them."

And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by\nnight, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go\nbelow. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan\nbut wondrous eyes did plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the\ndeck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,\nor exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the\nmain-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the\ncabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;\nhis hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he\nstood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung\nin his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never\ntell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\ntimes; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,\nthough he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and\nthe unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved\ncoat and hat.

But\nthough his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the\nParsee’s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these\ntwo never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals\nsome passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent\nspell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck\ncrew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak\none word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the\nslightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a\nsingle hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his\nscuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each\nother; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the\nParsee his abandoned substance.And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\nand every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab\nseemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both\nseemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean\nshade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and\nkeel was solid Ahab.At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard\nfrom aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till after\nsunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking\nof the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\nchildren-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac\nold man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly\nall except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether\nStubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But\nif these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from\nverbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them."

  "content": "“I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab\nmust have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of\nbasketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\nblock, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\ndownward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin\nfor the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with\nthat end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round\nupon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long\nupon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then\nsettling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the\nrope, sir—I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his\nperson in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his\nperch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and\nafterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the\nroyal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead,\nastern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded\nat so great a height.When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\nthe rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is\nhoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these\ncircumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict\ncharge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such\na wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations\naloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at\nthe deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few\nminutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural\nfatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor\nshould by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all\nswooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not\nunusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,\nalmost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with\nanything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those\ntoo, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt\nsomewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select\nfor his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise\ndistrusted person’s hands.Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\nminutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\nincommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\nlatitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\nhead in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a\nthousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and\nwent eddying again round his head.But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\nnot to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked\nit much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least\nheedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every\nsight."

But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen\naccounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on\nand on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;\nwhile from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was\ndimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably\nmisnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were\nfixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some\nwhaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine\nfeet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and\nsome few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you\nnow saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,\nhalf-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.“Hast seen the White Whale?”“Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with\nhis trumpet he pointed to the wreck.“Hast killed him?”“The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the\nother, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose\ngathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together."

Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these\nbarbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the\nfin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”“Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the\nhammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only\nyesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest\nwere buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning\nto his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and\nlift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with\nuplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the\nsound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not\nso quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have\nsprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy\nhanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake.\n“In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your\ntaffrail to show us your coffin!”CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were\nhardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was\ntransparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and\nman-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s\nchest in his sleep.Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\nunspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;\nbut to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed\nmighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,\ntroubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and\nshadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,\nthat distinguished them."
