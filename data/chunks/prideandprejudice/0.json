  "content": "[Illustration]_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving\nby allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies\nto books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very\nnumerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it\nbrings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as\nto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\nallowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\nproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\nunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\nfound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\nnovels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\nAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\ncritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\nof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\ndifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\nin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\ndelicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\ntheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\nwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\nEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\nvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\nyet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\nothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\nSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\nnot want them._"

On the other hand,\nI, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\nseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\neminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\nin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\ncause._"

  "content": "_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\nreader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\nwhen Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\nfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\n1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\ncombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\ncritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\nsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\npossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\nregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\ncould be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\nand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\nthéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\nstory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\nAll the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\nCollins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\nsame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\nhide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\nFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\nintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\nthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\nalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\nopportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\nbe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\nnatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\nby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\nthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\naversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\nthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\nsay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\ngarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\ndelicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\ncertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\nwhich, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\navail himself, appear at once on the stage._"

  "content": "_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\nmore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\nmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\nand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\nwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\nconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\nnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\ndisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\nfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\nacted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\nability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\nshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\nseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\nfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\nThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\nbut who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\nsuperior to them._"

  "content": "_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\nthat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\nexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differently\napprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\ngreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\nthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\nscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\nobvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\nfor there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\nJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\nmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\ncommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\navoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\ncertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\nwho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\nsavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\nof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\nher immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\nprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\nrestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\nroasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\nof course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\nnineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\nwould have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\nhusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\ninnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\nat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\nof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\nMentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\nwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\ndays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\nthink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\nown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\nher son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\nEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\nfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\nsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\nthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\nbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\nthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\nevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\nfool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\na cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\nhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\ntook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\nwork her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\nand I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\nwas immensely the better for it as an artist._"

  "content": "_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\nthat “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\ncombined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\nwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\npainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\nterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\nat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\nof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\nmyself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\nmicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\nlittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\npaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\nfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\nshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\nmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\nsingle failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\ncomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\nanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\nseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\nrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\nGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\nEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\nladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\npierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\ngravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\nsubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\nMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\ntaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\ntouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\neven in a black one._"

  "content": "_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\nonly genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\nfirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\ntrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\nhas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\nthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\nFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\npiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\nnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\nshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\nmyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\nNothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\nonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.\nBennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\nstirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\nhimself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\nbreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\njust and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\nshould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\nto Addison in others._"

  "content": "_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\nnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\nCollins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\never did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\nbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\n_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\nof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\ndistinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\nto conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\npossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\ndraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\nformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\nis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\nCollins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\n“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\nside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\nhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\nits formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\nits selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\nor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled\nwith reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\nare historically true._"

  "content": "_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\nexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\nfigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\nMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\nperhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me\nvery faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\nto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\nbirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\nas Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\nPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\nrich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\ndeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom present\nthemselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\nMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\nfor the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\nalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\nor himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\nthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\nexcept for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of\nthe elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\nconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\neven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\ndifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\nor when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\nthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his\nconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\ndo not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\nLet us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\nto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\nrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\npleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the\nresult of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\nreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\nthe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\nthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\noutside of these four._"

  "content": "_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\nalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties\ndifficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\nglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\namusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\nLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\ndifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\nvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\nweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has\ntaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\nnot merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\ntraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\nher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\nfirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\nsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\nperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings\nin that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\nto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\nrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\nCollins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\nthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\nthese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\npoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._"

  "content": "_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\nBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\nfurther than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\ndelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\ncomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\nthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\ndealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in\ndrab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\nnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\na cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\nhero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed.__Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\nMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\nwhose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into\ncomparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\nunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\nhis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\ncannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\nhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\nnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\nsudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s\nscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\neven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\nhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\nbeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\nunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\nhusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\nprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really\ninjured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\nlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\nphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\nonly she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\ncharm._"

  "content": "_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\nherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\nto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_\nallegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\nalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\nexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\nsometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\nabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the\nlively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost\nstrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and\nsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her\npropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give\nat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never\n“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest\nobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early\nspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to\nserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,\nas it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the\nfinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then\ntoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself\nor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with\nas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of\nthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same\nkind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have\nbeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons\nwho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the\ninjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family\naggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world.__Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a\ncommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her\nplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a\ncertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.\nNearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent\nDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the\nidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.\nElizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the\n“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)\nwomen have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea\nthat all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with\nher if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”\nshe has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of\npassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so\ninvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of\nthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.\nBut I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have\nmarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and\nanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’\nconversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked\nto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della\nCruscans of this._"

Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth\nBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara\nGrant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I\nshould, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana\nand Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one\nof the four can come into competition with Elizabeth.__GEORGE SAINTSBURY._[Illustration: List of Illustrations.]PAGEFrontispiece                                                          ivTitle-page                                                             vDedication                                                           viiHeading to Preface                                                    ixHeading to List of Illustrations                                     xxvHeading to Chapter I.                                                  1“He came down to see the place”                                        2Mr. and Mrs. Bennet                                                    5“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”                                      6“I’m the tallest”                                                      9“He rode a black horse”                                               10“When the party entered”                                              12“She is tolerable”                                                    15Heading to Chapter IV.                                                18Heading to Chapter V.                                                 22“Without once opening his lips”                                       24Tailpiece to Chapter V.                                               26Heading to Chapter VI.                                                27“The entreaties of several”                                           31“A note for Miss Bennet”                                              36“Cheerful prognostics”                                                40“The apothecary came”                                                 43“Covering a screen”                                                   45“Mrs. Bennet and her two youngest girls”                              53Heading to Chapter X.                                                 60“No, no; stay where you are”                                          67"

A single man of large fortune; four or\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”“How so? how can it affect them?”“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”“Is that his design in settling here?”“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.”“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.”“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.”“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”"

Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.”“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.”“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.”“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\nvisit them.”“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.”Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]][Illustration:“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER II.[Illustration]"

He\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\nsuddenly addressed her with,--“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\nresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\nof her.”“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\nnot depend on her serving you.”Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\nthem ill.”“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”“To-morrow fortnight.”“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\nshe will not know him herself.”“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\nMr. Bingley to _her_.”“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?”“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\nwill take it on myself.”The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\nnonsense!”"

I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\ngreat books, and make extracts.”Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\nBingley.”“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.”The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\nwhile.“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\nword about it till now.”“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\nshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\nor me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\nfor your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\nball.”“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\nreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\ndinner.[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”][Illustration:“He rode a black horse”\n]CHAPTER III.[Illustration]"

Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\nhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten\nminutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\nmuch; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper\nwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\nMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\naccept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\nhe might always be flying about from one place to another, and never\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\nlittle by starting the idea of his[Illustration:“When the Party entered”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a\nreport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a\nnumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing\nthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,\nhis five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the\nassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\ntwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man."
