Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\nkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\nhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\nopportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to\nsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\nthe subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I\nhave not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.”“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\nespecially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\ngrieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.”“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am\ninclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”"

I felt a\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\nbeing in love with each other many weeks.”“But not before they went to Brighton?”“No, I believe not.”“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\nknow his real character?”“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:\nbut I hope this may be false.”“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\nthis could not have happened!”“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”“We acted with the best intentions.”“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his\nwife?”“He brought it with him for us to see.”Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.

I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with\n     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the\n     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without\n     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at\n     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the\n     surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia\n     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for\n     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my\n     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will\n     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\n     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my\n     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to\n     mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed\n     up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will\n     drink to our good journey.“Your affectionate friend,“LYDIA BENNET.”“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had\nfinished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But\nat least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.\nWhatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a\n_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\nsuch confusion!”“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?”“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to\ngive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much\nas I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen\nalmost took from me my faculties.”“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look\nwell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety\nupon yourself alone.”“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\nfatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.\nKitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of\nrepose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on\nTuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady\nLucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if\nthey could be of use to us.”"

Assistance is impossible; condolence,\ninsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had\nintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where\nthey last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could\nbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the\nnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\ngentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be\nremarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\ndetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\nto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any\nother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,\nand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding\nout even so much as this.”[Illustration:The Post\n]CHAPTER XLVIII.[Illustration]The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next\nmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\nHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and\ndilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\nThey were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to\nsend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.\nGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant\ninformation of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,\nto prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to\nthe great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only\nsecurity for her husband’s not being killed in a duel."

  "content": "Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few\ndays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to\nher nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a\ngreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also\nvisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of\ncheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without\nreporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,\nshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\nthem.All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months\nbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt\nto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with\nthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.\nEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and\neverybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the\nappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above\nhalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of\nher sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still\nless of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now\ncome, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\nentirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some\nnews of them.Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a\nletter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately\nfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.\nThat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but\nwithout gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now\ndetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet\nthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first\ncoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself\ndid not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was\neager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.\nBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and\npromised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this\neffect:--"

If there\nwere anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such\na clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have\nnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in\nhis power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps\nLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any\nother person.”Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for\nher authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any\ninformation of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father\nand mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,\nhowever, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to\ngive more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting\nit, the application was a something to look forward to.Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\npart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was\nthe first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,\nwhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every\nsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for\ntheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane\nhad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\nshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\nletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.

The\n     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\n     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\n     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\n     of behaviour in your[Illustration:“To whom I have related the affair”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,\n     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,\n     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally\n     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an\n     age.

And this consideration leads me,\n     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain\n     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\n     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.

  "content": "Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from\nColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\nIt was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up\nany connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His\nformer acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the\nmilitia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship\nwith any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out\nas likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own\nfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to\nhis fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired\nthat he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\nColonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be\nnecessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the\ntown, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner\ndid not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;\nJane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly\nunexpected; I had not an idea of it.”Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their\nfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\nspiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to\nhis brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and\nleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\nfor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\nnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering\nwhat her anxiety for his life had been before.“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he\nwill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,\nand make him marry her, if he comes away?”As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she\nand her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet\ncame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their\njourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her\nDerbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.\nHis name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;\nand the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of\ntheir being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\nElizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from\nPemberley.The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for\nthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be\nfairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time\ntolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\nthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\nLydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,\none sleepless night out of two."

He said as little as he had ever been in the\nhabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him\naway; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of\nit.It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that\nElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly\nexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say\nnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,\nand I ought to feel it.”“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to\nfall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have\nbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\nIt will pass away soon enough.”“Do you suppose them to be in London?”“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there\nwill probably be of some duration.”Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no\nill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,\nconsidering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s\ntea.“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an\nelegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my\nlibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as\nI can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_\nshould ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,\nfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and\nyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house\nagain, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely\nprohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.

We have heard nothing from town.”“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know\nthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here\nthis half hour, and master has had a letter.”Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.

I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there\nare two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money\nyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever\nto pay him.”“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight\na temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am\ngone.”“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me\nbefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,\nit must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has\ndistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing\nless than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,\nin the very beginning of our relationship.”“Ten thousand pounds!

How could he spare half ten thousand\npounds?”“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said\nElizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall\nexactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has\nnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be\nrequited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\nprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\nyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\nactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\nshe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\nfirst sees my aunt!”“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said\nJane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry\nher is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of\nthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\nthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\ntime make their past imprudence forgotten.”“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor\nI, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”"

  "content": "It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\ntherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make\nit known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly\nreplied,--“Just as you please.”“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”“Take whatever you like, and get away.”Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs\ntogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication\nwould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\nthe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\nsoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,\nher joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\nexuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she\nhad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\nwould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\nfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will\nbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My\ngood, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\neverything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\nclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\nmuch he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\nLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\nGardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great\nmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to\nassist Mr. Wickham with money.”"

  "content": "“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\nmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\never had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\nIn a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\nit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you\nwrite for me. We will settle with your father about the money\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on\nLady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\nairing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do\nanything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\nall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s\nsituation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she\nhad need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,\nneither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly\nexpected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only\ntwo hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.[Illustration:“The spiteful old ladies”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER L.[Illustration]"

  "content": "Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,\ninstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\nthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\nhim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\nbe her husband might then have rested in its proper place.He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\nBennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\nlate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her\nhusband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\nincome.Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\nthrough her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\nthat sum."

  "content": "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\nanother very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have\nas little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\nof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\nnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\ndespatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\nits execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was\nindebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any\nmessage to her.The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\nspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\nphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of\nconversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\nhappiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant\nfarm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from\nall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\nin this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery\nwas considered certain.It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\nhappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\nspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\ntriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\nher wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\nservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\nproper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering\nwhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\nimportance.“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\ngreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\ntoo far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\nPurvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”"

  "content": "Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\nservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\nBennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the\nimprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\nsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\ndaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\naffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\nit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\npossible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\nclothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\ntook place.Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\nthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\nspot.She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\nbut at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s\nfrailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\ndisadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there\nseemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\nobjection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest\nkind with the man whom he so justly scorned."

  "content": "From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\nshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\nshould meet.What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\nproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now\nhave been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\ndoubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\nthere must be a triumph.She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\ndisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\ntemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\nwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease\nand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\nand from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\nhave received benefit of greater importance.But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\nconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\nprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\nfamily.How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she\ncould not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to\na couple who were only brought together because their passions were\nstronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\npromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\nthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\npurport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\non quitting the militia."

And I think you will agree with me, in\nconsidering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his\naccount and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\nRegulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are\nable and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\nensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is\nan advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\npromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\nhave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\nwritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\nand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\nin and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\npledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\nsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\na list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\nhope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\nall will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\nGardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\nleaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to\nyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.“E. GARDINER.”Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\nremoval from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\nMrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in\nthe north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her\ncompany, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in\nHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a\npity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted\nwith everybody, and had so many favourites.“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking\nto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she\nlikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s\nregiment.”His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\nadmitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,\nreceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who\nagreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,\nurged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her\nand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was\nprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their\nmother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show\nher married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to\nthe north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he\nsent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth\nwas surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;\nand, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him\nwould have been the last object of her wishes.[Illustration:“With an affectionate smile”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]CHAPTER LI.[Illustration]"

The carriage was sent to meet\nthem at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival\nwas dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who\ngave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_\nbeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister\nmust endure.They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive\nthem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\nanxious, uneasy.Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\nshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\nWickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an\nalacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\nenough to provoke him.Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\nLydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\nfrom sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at\nlength they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\nsome little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\ngreat while since she had been there.Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\nwere always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth\nhad not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\ndown, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\nimpudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\ncolour."
