  "content": "The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\nfixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see\ntheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\nless on any single event, or any particular person; for though they\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\nhad no disinclination for it.“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\neverybody.”Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he\ndid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,\neither from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\ndance."

  "content": "“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of\nthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\nhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\nmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.”Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\ninstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;\nfor, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\ntrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement\nof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on\nTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.[Illustration]CHAPTER XVIII."

  "content": "[Illustration]Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s\npleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\nsmile,--“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\nElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\nWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\nAttention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her."

  "content": "But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\nspirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she\nhad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary\ntransition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\nparticular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\ndistress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\nsolemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\ndisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\nrelease from him was ecstasy.She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\nknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\nmind: Charlotte tried to console her.“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\nevil.”When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\nin the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\nfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\nwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\nshe made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\nwith--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\ndance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\nroom, or the number of couples.”He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\nsaid."

Perhaps, by-and-by, I\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\n_now_ we may be silent.”“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.”“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?”“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\nposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\nsaid he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\nthink it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”“I must not decide on my own performance.”He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\nthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.”The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\nfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\nconstrained manner said,--“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\n_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\nis less certain.”“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\nwith emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.”"

  "content": "Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\nDarcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\nhis dancing and his partner.“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\nat her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”[Illustration:“Such very superior dancing is not\noften seen.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\nWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\nhe turned to his partner, and said,--“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking\nof.”“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\nthemselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\nand what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.”“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\nsomething else.”“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\nwith a look of doubt."

You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\ncreated_?”“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”“I hope not.”“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\nto be secure of judging properly at first.”“May I ask to what these questions tend?”“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\nto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”“And what is your success?”She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.”“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\nin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\nanother.They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\nwith an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--"

  "content": "“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\nquestions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\nother communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\nDarcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\nimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\nhim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\nmost infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\nwell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\nto hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\ncould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\nHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\nI wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\ndiscovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\ndescent, one could not expect much better.”“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\nsaid Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\nworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\nassure you, he informed me himself.”“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\nDarcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\nfor Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\nway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\nsister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\nyou may be sure of my pardon.”“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\nthe probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\nsister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\nregard.”“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”"

But what does he say of the living?”“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\nhim _conditionally_ only.”“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\n“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\nBingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\nboth gentlemen as I did before.”She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\ndelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\nBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\nand told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\nas to make a most important discovery.“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\nin the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”"

Her cousin prefaced his speech with\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\n“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\nunrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\nreplied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.

She saw her in idea settled in that\nvery house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\nbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\neven to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\nsaw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\nlest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\nshe considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\none of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\ntalking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\nelse but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.\nBingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\nof fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\na charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\nwere the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\ncomfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\ncertain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\nwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\nJane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\nand, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\nconsign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\nnot be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\nto make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\noccasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\nchance of it."

Her\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?

But not long was the interval of\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\nentreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\nElizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\nshe watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\namongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\nbegan another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\nher voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\nShe looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\ntalking to Bingley.

He took the hint,\nand, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\nrector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\nan agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\neverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\ncannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\nshould omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\nconnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\nroom. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\nBennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\nhaving spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\nLucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man."

That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\nsomebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\nroom. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\nto it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\nhimself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\nclose to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\nproject. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\noften joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\nto herself.She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\nit."

Mrs. Hurst and her\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\nspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\nhow tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\npleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\nwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\ngo the next day for a short time.Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.[Illustration:“to assure you in the most animated language”\n]CHAPTER XIX.[Illustration]The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\ncourse of this morning?”"

I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\nshe can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\ncalled out,--“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\nme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\ngoing away myself.”“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And\nupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\nto escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\nMr. Collins.”Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\nto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\nbetween distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\nsoon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\nmother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”"

Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\nleft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\narranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\nin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”"

Accept my thanks for\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\nthem.”“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\nhand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\nthird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\njust said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\nwould make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\nsituation.”“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\nvery gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\ndisapprove of you.

I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\naddressed her,--“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\nfirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\nfemale character.”“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\nmay convince you of its being one.”“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\nrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\nis unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\nbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\nwith the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\nconsideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\nportion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the\neffects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\ntherefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”"

My feelings in every respect\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer?
