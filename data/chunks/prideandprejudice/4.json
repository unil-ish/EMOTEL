  "content": "Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\nto _insist_ upon her marrying him.”“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\npresent occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.”Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\nher interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\ninterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\nvaried, however, her determination never did.Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\nHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\nway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\ndeserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\nthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\nher, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such\nfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”[Illustration:“they entered the breakfast room”\n]"

But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it\ninto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\nto maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep\nyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\nand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\nto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\nto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\nno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\nis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\nattempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\nShe talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\nthey were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\nthan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\nlet Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\nnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\nconversation:--“Oh, Mr. Collins!”"

Resignation to\ninevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man\nwho has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I\ntrust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\npositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\nhave often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\nYou will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your\nfamily, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\ndaughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\nMy conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\ndismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all\nliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”[Illustration]CHAPTER XXI.[Illustration]The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\nAs for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\nby embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\nstiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to\nher; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\nespecially to her friend.The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill\nhealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\nnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\nSaturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham\nwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\nHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\naunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were\nwell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\nthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet\nMr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”"

The envelope contained a\nsheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\nJane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to\njoin, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they\nhad gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is\nfrom Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way\nto town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\nwhat she says.”"

  "content": "She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to\nregret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my\ndearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many\nreturns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the\nmeanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these\nhigh-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.”“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\nwhom we shall deprive you.’“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this\nwinter.”“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”"

  "content": "“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is\nimpatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\nless eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\nher equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\nshe inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still\nmore interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\nyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said\nJane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\ndeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;\nthat she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that\nif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\nkindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\nsubject?”“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”“Most willingly.”“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.”Jane shook her head.“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\ntogether can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\ncase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\nthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\ndearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\nherself.”“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\nwill not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?”"

A thousand things may arise in six months.”The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\ninterested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of everyone.She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\nJane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\nBingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\nthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\nLongbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\nthat, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\ncare to have two full courses.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXII.[Illustration]"

This was\nvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\nhad any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\nBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\ncharacter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\nfrom a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\ntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\nreception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there."

The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\nestablishment were gained.Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.

The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\noccasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\nfrom their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\nto consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\nCollins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\nirksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\nbe her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\nmarriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\nprovision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\nfrom want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\ntwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\nluck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\nsurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\nvalued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\nto give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\nquestions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\npublish his prosperous love."

You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\noffending your patroness.”“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\nmaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\naffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.

Mrs. Bennet wished\nto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\nher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\nkind was done away.

Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\nfor it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\nwished her all imaginable happiness.“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\nvery much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\nBut when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never\nwas.

The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\nnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\nmost humiliating picture!

Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\nconsole and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\nscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\nor Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\ncould at all forgive their daughter.Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\nmore foolish than his daughter!Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and\nLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\nto spread at Meryton.Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on\nMrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\nthough Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\nenough to drive happiness away.Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no\nreal confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as\nBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return."

  "content": "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\ntwelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After\ndischarging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,\nwith many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the\naffection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained\nthat it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had\nbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\nLongbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;\nfor Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that\nshe wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would\nbe an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early\nday for making him the happiest of men.Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\ncomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\nand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued\nabsence.Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\nfalsehood.Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she\nwas to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\nfrequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\nDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for\nthe strength of his attachment.As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\npainful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of\nconcealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\nwas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an\nhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\ndid not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all\nJane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\ntranquillity."

  "content": "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\nfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\nand, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\nfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.[Illustration:“_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”\n]Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\nMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\nand her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced\nto make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\nbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”“What should not you mind?”“I should not mind anything at all.”“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.”“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own\ndaughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!\nWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXIV.[Illustration]"

  "content": "Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\nthe country.Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\ninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\nfor her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s\nassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\nthe caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\nwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\ncould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had\nreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;\nwhether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had\nescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\nhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded."

  "content": "A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\nnot help saying,--“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I\nwill not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\nall be as we were before.”Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\nnothing.“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no\nreason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\nacquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\nnothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little\ntime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.”“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\nyou. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\ndeserve.”Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\nthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be\nafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\nof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\nor sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,\nthe other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it\nis unaccountable!”"

  "content": "“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of\nsituation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and\nCharlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a\nlarge family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be\nready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like\nregard and esteem for our cousin.”“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\ndanger security for happiness.”“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied\nJane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy\ntogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\nmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\nto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\nour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\nit does.”“And men take care that they should.”“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”\nsaid Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\nunhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\nwant of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,\nwill do the business.”“And do you impute it to either of those?”"

They can\nonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can\nsecure it.”“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\nhappiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\nconnections, and pride.”“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;\n“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\nknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\nher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\nthey should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to\npart us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\nunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.

  "content": "Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no\nmore; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account\nfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it\nwith less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what\nshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely\nthe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw\nher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at\nthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\ncomfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one\nday, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next\nto being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and\nthen. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction\namong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to\nbe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at\nMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham\nbe your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not\nall expect Jane’s good fortune.”“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of\nthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will\nalways make the most of it.”Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom\nwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn\nfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now\nadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already\nheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,\nwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was\npleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they\nhad known anything of the matter.Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any\nextenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of\nHertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for\nallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else\nMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.[Illustration]CHAPTER XXV.[Illustration]"
