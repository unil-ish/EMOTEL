  "content": "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\ngave them meaning.It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but\nwhenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\nremoved from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her\nthat the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,\nhowever temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one\nday. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the\ngood opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would\nhave been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,\nbut to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\ntheir last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the\nchange was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could\nhardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the\ncompany of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could\nresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\nRosings."

Miss Darcy, though with a\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and\non this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\nvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry."

  "content": "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\nthat the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged."

  "content": "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\noverlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\nwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\nwhere their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\nopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\na change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\nsuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\nmeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,\nshe esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses."

  "content": "It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very\nday of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late\nbreakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.[Illustration:“Engaged by the river”\n]CHAPTER XLV.[Illustration]Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome\nher appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know\nwith how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now\nbe renewed.On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\ninferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her."

  "content": "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she\nfeared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\nBingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\nthem round the table.While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\nregret that he came."

  "content": "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.”In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\nthat corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend."

  "content": "Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,\nMiss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s\nperson, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her\nbrother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment\ncould not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave\nGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and\namiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\nrepeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I\nnever in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\nShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.”However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see\nany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.”"

He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,--“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_\na beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time.”“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_\nwas only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\nboth. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\nexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\nbeginning the subject.[Illustration]Chapter XLVI.[Illustration]Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from\nJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been\nrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on\nthe third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the\nreceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that\nit had been mis-sent elsewhere.

The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\nmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\nto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and\nlet us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\nthankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\ntwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\nknow what I have written.”Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing\nwhat she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the\nother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it\nhad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first."

Dearest\nLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated\nto Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but\nno farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a\nhackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the\nLondon road. I know not what to think. After making every possible\ninquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\nanxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet\nand Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to\npass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and\nbroke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\nI am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any\nblame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and\nmother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many\ncircumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married\nprivately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_\ncould form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,\nwhich is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\nImpossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed\nto depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my\nhopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother\nis really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be\nbetter, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in\nmy life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot\nwonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\nsomething of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is\nover, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,\nhowever, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen\nagain to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances\nare such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as\nsoon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of\nthe former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,\nto try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but\nhis excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the\nbest and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton\nagain to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and\nassistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”"

Her pale face and\nimpetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself\nenough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\nI must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;\nI have not an instant to lose.”“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;\nbut let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.

Is there nothing you could take to give you\npresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There\nis nothing the matter with me.

Had I but explained\nsome part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had\nhis character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,\nall too late now.”“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it\ncertain, absolutely certain?”“Oh, yes!

He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\nand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\nwas sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\nwonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.

But I will not torment\nyou with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\nThis unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\nreason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with\nonly one serious parting look, went away.As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination."

But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a\nhope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\nof all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,\nthat Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\nprey.She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\nfluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\nfeel it!She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost\nimportance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\nwas severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never\nbeen a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\npromised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\nby one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\nsettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be\ndone about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?”“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n_That_ is all settled.”"

Oh, that I knew how it was!”But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\nbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\nGardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.[Illustration:“The first pleasing earnest of their welcome”\n]CHAPTER XLVII.[Illustration]“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they\ndrove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\nmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\nmatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form\nsuch a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\nnot adequate to the risk.”“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\nWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\nhim capable of it?”"

Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\ncase?”“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.”“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\npresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\nBarnet road.”“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\nfriend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\ndo as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\nsuch a matter.”“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,\nas to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”"

But, really, I know not what to say.\nPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never\nbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\nnay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\nand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\nand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\nSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\nflirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\neverything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\ngreater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which\nare naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\ncharm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of\nWickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\ntheir former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\ntill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\nWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\nsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\nas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\nas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day\nof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\nLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with\nsuch forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\ncircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\nrelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\nwhat he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\nreserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\nmust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\nher.”“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\nand Jane seem so well to understand?”"

And when I returned home the ----shire\nwas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the\ncase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\nnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\napparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the\nneighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\nwas settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\nopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\nbe in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\nconsequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\nenough from my thoughts.”“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\nsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?”“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\nside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\nthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\nhe entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\nwere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\nthe first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\nattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\nwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\nwho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\nto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by\nits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\nthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.\nFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could\nfind no interval of ease or forgetfulness.They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\nthe road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort\nto Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long\nexpectations.The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\non the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\nfaces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from\nher mother’s apartment, immediately met her."

He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\nagain, till he had something of importance to mention.”“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\nshaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\nHeaven! are quite well.”“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\nmust have gone through!”Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of\nthe whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\nhad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\nfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\nhowever, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\nto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage."
