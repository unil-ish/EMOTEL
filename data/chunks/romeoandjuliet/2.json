Therefore hence, be gone.\nBut if thou jealous dost return to pry\nIn what I further shall intend to do,\nBy heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild;\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.BALTHASAR.\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.ROMEO.\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\nLive, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.BALTHASAR.\nFor all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.[_Retires_]ROMEO.\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\nGorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,[_Breaking open the door of the monument._]And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.PARIS.\nThis is that banish’d haughty Montague\nThat murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,\nIt is supposed, the fair creature died,—\nAnd here is come to do some villainous shame\nTo the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.[_Advances._]Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.\nCan vengeance be pursu’d further than death?\nCondemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\nObey, and go with me, for thou must die.ROMEO.\nI must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\nGood gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.\nFly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\nPut not another sin upon my head\nBy urging me to fury. O be gone.\nBy heaven I love thee better than myself;\nFor I come hither arm’d against myself.\nStay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,\nA madman’s mercy bid thee run away.PARIS.\nI do defy thy conjuration,\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.ROMEO.\nWilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy![_They fight._]PAGE.\nO lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.[_Exit._]PARIS.\nO, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,\nOpen the tomb, lay me with Juliet.[_Dies._]"

Beauty’s ensign yet\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\nAnd death’s pale flag is not advanced there.\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\nO, what more favour can I do to thee\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\nForgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous;\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee,\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\nWill I set up my everlasting rest;\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\nFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.\nArms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\nThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.\nHere’s to my love!
