  "content": "This event, over and above the conjugal affliction with which it\ninvaded the lady’s quiet, would have involved her in infinite\ndifficulty and distress, with regard to her temporal concerns, by\nleaving her unprotected in the midst of strangers, had not she been\nthus providentially supplied with an effectual patron in the colonel,\nwho was known by the appellation of Count Melvil. He no sooner saw her,\nby the death of her husband, detached from all personal connexions with\na military life, than he proposed that she should quit her occupation\nin the camp, and retire to his habitation in the city of Presburg,\nwhere she would be entertained in ease and plenty during the remaining\npart of her natural life. With all due acknowledgments of his\ngenerosity, she begged to be excused from embracing his proposal,\nalleging she was so much accustomed to her present way of life, and so\nmuch devoted to the service of the soldiery, that she should never be\nhappy in retirement, while the troops of any prince in Christendom kept\nthe field.The Count, finding her determined to prosecute her scheme, repeated his\npromise of befriending her upon all occasions; and in the meantime\nadmitted Ferdinand into the number of his domestics, resolving that he\nshould be brought up in attendance upon his own son, who was a boy of\nthe same age. He kept him, however, in his tent, until he should have\nan opportunity of revisiting his family in person; and, before that\noccasion offered, two whole years elapsed, during which the illustrious\nPrince Eugene gained the celebrated battle of Belgrade, and afterwards\nmade himself master of that important frontier.CHAPTER FOURHIS MOTHER’S PROWESS AND DEATH; TOGETHER WITH SOME INSTANCES OF HIS OWN\nSAGACITY.It would have been impossible for the mother of our adventurer, such as\nshe hath been described, to sit quietly in her tent, while such an\nheroic scene was acting. She was no sooner apprised of the general’s\nintention to attack the enemy, than she, as usual, packed up her\nmoveables in a waggon, which she committed to the care of a peasant in\nthe neighbourhood, and put herself in motion with the troops; big with\nthe expectation of re-acting that part in which she had formerly\nacquitted herself so much to her advantage.—Nay, she by this time\nlooked upon her own presence as a certain omen of success to the cause\nwhich she espoused; and, in their march to battle, actually encouraged\nthe ranks with repeated declarations, importing, that she had been\neye-witness of ten decisive engagements, in all of which her friends\nhad been victorious, and imputing such uncommon good fortune to some\nsupernatural quality inherent in her person."

But, certain it is, the\nvictory began from that quarter in which she had posted herself; and no\ncorps in the army behaved with such intrepidity as that which was\nmanifested by those who were favoured with her admonitions and example;\nfor she not only exposed her person to the enemy’s fire, with the\nindifference and deliberation of a veteran, but she is said to have\nachieved a very conspicuous exploit by the prowess of her single arm.\nThe extremity of the line to which she had attached herself, being\nassaulted in flank by a body of the spahis, wheeled about, in order to\nsustain the charge, and received them with such a seasonable fire, as\nbrought a great number of turbans to the ground; among those who fell,\nwas one of the chiefs or agas, who had advanced before the rest, with a\nview to signalise his valour.Our English Penthesilea no sooner saw this Turkish leader drop, than,\nstruck with the magnificence of his own and horse’s trappings, she\nsprung forward to seize them as her prize, and found the aga not dead,\nthough in a good measure disabled by his misfortune, which was entirely\nowing to the weight of his horse, that, having been killed by a\nmusket-ball, lay upon his leg, so that he could not disengage himself.\nNevertheless, perceiving the virago approach with fell intent, he\nbrandished his symitar, and tried to intimidate his assailant with a\nmost horrible exclamation; but it was not the dismal yell of a\ndismounted cavalier, though enforced with a hideous ferocity of\ncountenance, and the menacing gestures with which he waited her\napproach, that could intimidate such an undaunted she-campaigner; she\nsaw him writhing in the agonies of a situation from which he could not\nmove; and, running towards him with the nimbleness and intrepidity of a\nCamilla, described a semicircle in the progress of her assault, and\nattacking him on one side, plunged her well-tried dagger in his throat.\nThe shades of death encompassed him, his life-blood issued at the\nwound, he fell prone upon the earth, he bit the dust, and having thrice\ninvoked the name of Allah! straight expired."

  "content": "While his destiny was thus fulfilled, his followers began to reel; they\nseemed dismayed at the fate of their chief, beheld their companions\ndrop like the leaves in autumn, and suddenly halted in the midst of\ntheir career. The Imperialists, observing the confusion of the enemy,\nredoubled their fire; and, raising a dreadful shout, advanced in order\nto improve the advantage they had gained. The spahis durst not wait the\nshock of such an encounter; they wheeled to the right-about, and\nclapping spurs to their horses, fled in the utmost disorder. This was\nactually the circumstance that turned the scale of battle. The\nAustrians pursued their good fortune with uncommon impetuosity, and in\na few minutes left the field clear for the mother of our hero, who was\nsuch an adept in the art of stripping, that in the twinkling of an eye\nthe bodies of the aga and his Arabian lay naked to the skin. It would\nhave been happy for her, had she been contented with these\nfirst-fruits, reaped from the fortune of the day, and retired with her\nspoils, which were not inconsiderable; but, intoxicated with the glory\nshe had won, enticed by the glittering caparisons that lay scattered on\nthe plain, and without doubt prompted by the secret instinct of her\nfate, she resolved to seize opportunity by the forelock, and once for\nall indemnify herself for the many fatigues, hazards, and sorrows she\nhad undergone.Thus determined, she reconnoitred the field, and practised her address\nso successfully, that in less than half an hour she was loaded with\nermine and embroidery, and disposed to retreat with her burden, when\nher regards were solicited by a splendid bundle, which she descried at\nsome distance lying on the ground. This was no other than an unhappy\nofficer of hussars; who, after having the good fortune to take a\nTurkish standard, was desperately wounded in the thigh, and obliged to\nquit his horse; finding himself in such a helpless condition, he had\nwrapped his acquisition round his body, that whatever might happen, he\nand his glory should not be parted; and thus shrouded, among the dying\nand the dead, he had observed the progress of our heroine, who stalked\nabout the field, like another Atropos, finishing, wherever she came,\nthe work of death. He did not at all doubt, that he himself would be\nvisited in the course of her peregrinations, and therefore provided for\nher reception, with a pistol ready cocked in his hand, while he lay\nperdue beneath his covert, in all appearance bereft of life. He was not\ndeceived in his prognostic; she no sooner eyed the golden crescent\nthan, inflamed with curiosity or cupidity, she directed thitherward her\nsteps, and discerning the carcase of a man, from which, she thought,\nthere would be a necessity for disengaging it, she lifted up her\nweapon, in order to make sure of her purchase; and in the very instant\nof discharging her blow, received a brace of bullets in her brain."

  "content": "Thus ended the mortal pilgrimage of this modern Amazon; who, in point\nof courage, was not inferior to Semiramis, Tomyris, Zenobia,\nThalestris, or any boasted heroine of ancient times. It cannot be\nsupposed that this catastrophe made a very deep impression upon the\nmind of young Ferdinand, who had just then attained the ninth year of\nhis age, and been for a considerable time weaned from her maternal\ncaresses; especially as he felt no wants nor grievances in the family\nof the Count, who favoured him with a particular share of indulgence,\nbecause he perceived in him a spirit of docility, insinuation, and\nsagacity, far above his years. He did not, however, fail to lament the\nuntimely fate of his mother, with such filial expressions of sorrow, as\nstill more intimately recommended him to his patron; who, being himself\na man of extraordinary benevolence, looked upon the boy as a prodigy of\nnatural affection, and foresaw in his future services a fund of\ngratitude and attachment, that could not fail to render him a valuable\nacquisition to his family.In his own country, he had often seen connexions of that sort, which\nhaving been planted in the infancy of the adherent, had grown up to a\nsurprising pitch of fidelity and friendship, that no temptation could\nbias, and no danger dissolve. He therefore rejoiced in the hope of\nseeing his own son accommodated with such a faithful attendant, in the\nperson of young Fathom, on whom he resolved to bestow the same\neducation he had planned for the other, though conveyed in such a\nmanner as should be suitable to the sphere in which he was ordained to\nmove. In consequence of these determinations, our young adventurer led\na very easy life, in quality of page to the Count, in whose tent he lay\nupon a pallet, close to his field-bed, and often diverted him with his\nchildish prattle in the English tongue, which the more seldom his\nmaster had occasion to speak, he the more delighted to hear. In the\nexercise of his function, the boy was incredibly assiduous and alert;\nfar from neglecting the little particulars of his duty, and embarking\nin the mischievous amusements of the children belonging to the camp, he\nwas always diligent, sedate, agreeably officious and anticipating; and\nin the whole of his behaviour seemed to express the most vigilant sense\nof his patron’s goodness and generosity; nay, to such a degree had\nthese sentiments, in all appearance, operated upon his reflection, that\none morning, while he supposed the Count asleep, he crept softly to his\nbedside, and gently kissing his hand, which happened to be uncovered,\npronounced, in a low voice, a most fervent prayer in his behalf,\nbeseeching Heaven to shower down blessings upon him, as the widow’s\nfriend and the orphan’s father. This benediction was not lost upon the\nCount, who chanced to be awake, and heard it with admiration; but what\nriveted Ferdinand in his good graces, was a discovery that our youth\nmade, while his master was upon duty in the trenches before Belgrade."

  "content": "Two foot soldiers, standing sentry near the door of the tent, were\ncaptivated with the sight of some valuable moveables belonging to it;\nand supposing, in their great wisdom, that the city of Belgrade was too\nwell fortified to be taken during that campaign, they came to a\nresolution of withdrawing themselves from the severe service of the\ntrenches, by deserting to the enemy, after they should have rifled\nCount Melvil’s tent of the furniture by which they were so powerfully\nallured. The particulars of this plan were concerted in the French\nlanguage, which, they imagined, would screen them from all risk of\nbeing detected, in case they should be overheard, though, as there was\nno living creature in sight, they had no reason to believe that any\nperson was privy to their conversation. Nevertheless, they were\nmistaken in both these conjectures. The conference reached the ears of\nFathom, who was at the other end of the tent, and had perceived the\neager looks with which they considered some parts of the furniture. He\nhad penetration enough to suspect their desire, and, alarmed by that\nsuspicion, listened attentively to their discourse; which, from a\nslender knowledge in the French tongue, he had the good fortune partly\nto understand.This important piece of intelligence he communicated to the Count at\nhis return, and measures were immediately taken to defeat the design,\nand make an example of the authors, who being permitted to load\nthemselves with the booty, were apprehended in their retreat, and\npunished with death according to their demerits.CHAPTER FIVEA BRIEF DETAIL OF HIS EDUCATION.Nothing could have more seasonably happened to confirm the good opinion\nwhich the colonel entertained of Ferdinand’s principles. His intentions\ntowards the boy grew every day more and more warm; and, immediately\nafter the peace of Passarowitz, he retired to his own house at\nPresburg, and presented young Fathom to his lady, not only as the son\nof a person to whom he owed his life, but also as a lad who merited his\npeculiar protection and regard by his own personal virtue. The\nCountess, who was an Hungarian, received him with great kindness and\naffability, and her son was ravished with the prospect of enjoying such\na companion. In short, fortune seemed to have provided for him an\nasylum, in which he might be safely trained up, and suitably prepared\nfor more important scenes of life than any of his ancestors had ever\nknown."

  "content": "He was not, in all respects, entertained on the footing of his young\nmaster; yet he shared in all his education and amusements, as one whom\nthe old gentleman was fully determined to qualify for the station of an\nofficer in the service; and, if he did not eat with the Count, he was\nevery day regaled with choice bits from his table; holding, as it were,\na middle place between the rank of a relation and favourite domestic.\nAlthough his patron maintained a tutor in the house, to superintend the\nconduct of his heir, he committed the charge of his learning to the\ninstructions of a public school; where he imagined the boy would imbibe\na laudable spirit of emulation among his fellows, which could not fail\nof turning out to the advantage of his education. Ferdinand was entered\nin the same academy; and the two lads proceeded equally in the paths of\nerudition; a mutual friendship and intimacy soon ensued, and,\nnotwithstanding the levity and caprice commonly discernible in the\nbehaviour of such boys, very few or rather no quarrels happened in the\ncourse of their communication. Yet their dispositions were altogether\ndifferent, and their talents unlike. Nay, this dissimilarity was the\nvery bond of their union; because it prevented that jealousy and\nrivalship which often interrupts the harmony of two warm\ncontemporaries.The young Count made extraordinary progress in the exercises of the\nschool, though he seemed to take very little pains in the cultivation\nof his studies; and became a perfect hero in all the athletic\ndiversions of his fellow-scholars; but, at the same time, exhibited\nsuch a bashful appearance and uncouth address, that his mother\ndespaired of ever seeing him improved into any degree of polite\nbehaviour. On the other hand, Fathom, who was in point of learning a\nmere dunce, became, even in his childhood, remarkable among the ladies\nfor his genteel deportment and vivacity; they admired the proficiency\nhe made under the directions of his dancing-master, the air with which\nhe performed his obeisance at his entrance and exit; and were charmed\nwith the agreeable assurance and lively sallies of his conversation;\nwhile they expressed the utmost concern and disgust at the boorish\ndemeanour of his companion, whose extorted bows resembled the pawings\nof a mule, who hung his head in silence like a detected sheep-stealer,\nwho sat in company under the most awkward expressions of constraint,\nand whose discourse never exceeded the simple monosyllables of negation\nand assent."

  "content": "In vain did all the females of the family propose to him young Fathom,\nas a pattern and reproach. He remained unaltered by all their efforts\nand expostulations, and allowed our adventurer to enjoy the triumph of\nhis praise, while he himself was conscious of his own superiority in\nthose qualifications which seemed of more real importance than the mere\nexteriors and forms of life. His present ambition was not to make a\nfigure at his father’s table, but to eclipse his rivals at school, and\nto acquire an influence and authority among these confederates.\nNevertheless, Fathom might possibly have fallen under his displeasure\nor contempt, had not that pliant genius found means to retain his\nfriendship by seasonable compliances and submission; for the sole\nstudy, or at least the chief aim of Ferdinand, was to make himself\nnecessary and agreeable to those on whom his dependence was placed. His\ntalent was in this particular suited to his inclination; he seemed to\nhave inherited it from his mother’s womb; and, without all doubt, would\nhave raised upon it a most admirable superstructure of fortune and\napplause, had not it been inseparably yoked with a most insidious\nprinciple of self-love, that grew up with him from the cradle, and left\nno room in his heart for the least particle of social virtue. This\nlast, however, he knew so well how to counterfeit, by means of a large\nshare of ductility and dissimulation, that, surely, he was calculated\nby nature to dupe even the most cautious, and gratify his appetites, by\nlevying contributions on all mankind.So little are the common instructors of youth qualified to judge the\ncapacities of those who are under their tutelage and care, that Fathom,\nby dint of his insinuating arts, made shift to pass upon the\nschoolmaster as a lad of quick parts, in despite of a natural\ninaptitude to retain his lessons, which all his industry could never\novercome. In order to remedy, or rather to cloak this defect in his\nunderstanding, he had always recourse to the friendship of the young\nCount, who freely permitted him to transcribe his exercises, until a\nsmall accident happened, which had well-nigh put a stop to these\ninstances of his generosity.—The adventure, inconsiderable as it is, we\nshall record, as the first overt act of Ferdinand’s true character, as\nwell as an illustration of the opinion we have advanced touching the\nblind and injudicious decisions of a right pedagogue."

  "content": "Among other tasks imposed by the pedant upon the form to which our two\ncompanions belonged, they were one evening ordered to translate a\nchapter of Caesar’s Commentaries. Accordingly the young Count went to\nwork, and performed the undertaking with great elegance and despatch.\nFathom, having spent the night in more effeminate amusements, was next\nmorning so much hurried for want of time, that in his transcription he\nneglected to insert a few variations from the text, these being the\nterms on which he was allowed to use it; so that it was verbatim a copy\nof the original. As those exercises were always delivered in a heap,\nsubscribed with the several names of the boys to whom they belonged,\nthe schoolmaster chanced to peruse the version of Ferdinand, before he\nlooked into any of the rest, and could not help bestowing upon it\nparticular marks of approbation. The next that fell under his\nexamination was that of the young Count, when he immediately perceived\nthe sameness, and, far from imputing it to the true cause, upbraided\nhim with having copied the exercise of our adventurer, and insisted\nupon chastising him upon the spot for his want of application.Had not the young gentleman thought his honour was concerned, he would\nhave submitted to the punishment without murmuring; but he inherited,\nfrom his parents, the pride of two fierce nations, and, being\noverwhelmed with reproaches for that which he imagined ought to have\nredounded to his glory, he could not brook the indignity, and boldly\naffirmed, that he himself was the original, to whom Ferdinand was\nbeholden for his performance. The schoolmaster, nettled to find himself\nmistaken in his judgment, resolved that the Count should have no cause\nto exult in the discovery he had made, and, like a true flogger,\nactually whipped him for having allowed Fathom to copy his exercise.\nNay, in the hope of vindicating his own penetration, he took an\nopportunity of questioning Ferdinand in private concerning the\ncircumstances of the translation, and our hero, perceiving his drift,\ngave him such artful and ambiguous answers, as persuaded him that the\nyoung Count had acted the part of a plagiary, and that the other had\nbeen restrained from doing himself justice, by the consideration of his\nown dependence."

  "content": "This profound director did not fail, in honour of his own discernment,\nto whisper about the misrepresentation, as an instance of the young\nCount’s insolence, and Fathom’s humility and good sense. The story was\ncirculated among the servants, especially the maids belonging to the\nfamily, whose favour our hero had acquired by his engaging behaviour;\nand at length it reached the ears of his patron, who, incensed at his\nson’s presumption and inhospitality, called him to a severe account,\nwhen the young gentleman absolutely denied the truth of the allegation,\nand appealed to the evidence of Fathom himself. Our adventurer was\naccordingly summoned by the father, and encouraged to declare the\ntruth, with an assurance of his constant protection; upon which\nFerdinand very wisely fell upon his knees, and, while the tears gushed\nfrom his eyes, acquitted the young Count of the imputation, and\nexpressed his apprehension, that the report had been spread by some of\nhis enemies, who wanted to prejudice him in the opinion of his patron.The old gentleman was not satisfied of his son’s integrity by this\ndeclaration; being naturally of a generous disposition, highly\nprepossessed in favour of the poor orphan, and chagrined at the\nunpromising appearance of his heir, he suspected that Fathom was\noverawed by the fear of giving offence, and that, notwithstanding what\nhe had said, the case really stood as it had been represented. In this\npersuasion, he earnestly exhorted his son to resist and combat with any\nimpulse he might feel within himself, tending to selfishness, fraud, or\nimposition; to encourage every sentiment of candour and benevolence,\nand to behave with moderation and affability to all his\nfellow-creatures. He laid upon him strong injunctions, not without a\nmixture of threats, to consider Fathom as the object of his peculiar\nregard; to respect him as the son of the Count’s preserver, as a\nBriton, a stranger, and, above all, an helpless orphan, to whom the\nrights of hospitality were doubly due."

  "content": "Such admonitions were not lost upon the youth, who, under the rough\nhusk of his personal exhibition, possessed a large share of generous\nsensibility. Without any formal professions to his father, he resolved\nto govern himself according to his remonstrances; and, far from\nconceiving the least spark of animosity against Fathom, he looked upon\nthe poor boy as the innocent cause of his disgrace, and redoubled his\nkindness towards him, that his honour might never again be called in\nquestion, upon the same subject. Nothing is more liable to\nmisconstruction than an act of uncommon generosity; one half of the\nworld mistake the motive, from want of ideas to conceive an instance of\nbeneficence that soars so high above the level of their own sentiments;\nand the rest suspect it of something sinister or selfish, from the\nsuggestions of their own sordid and vicious inclinations. The young\nCount subjected himself to such misinterpretation, among those who\nobserved the increased warmth of civility and complaisance in his\nbehaviour to Ferdinand. They ascribed it to his desire of still\nprofiting by our adventurer’s superior talents, by which alone they\nsupposed him enabled to maintain any degree of reputation at school; or\nto the fear of being convicted by him of some misdemeanour of which he\nknew himself guilty. These suspicions were not effaced by the conduct\nof Ferdinand, who, when examined on the subject, managed his answers in\nsuch a manner, as confirmed their conjectures, while he pretended to\nrefute them, and at the same time acquired to himself credit for his\nextraordinary discretion and self-denial.If he exhibited such a proof of sagacity in the twelfth year of his\nage, what might not be expected from his finesse in the maturity of his\nfaculties and experience? Thus secured in the good graces of the whole\nfamily, he saw the days of his puerility glide along in the most\nagreeable elapse of caresses and amusement. He never fairly plunged\ninto the stream of school-education, but, by floating on the surface,\nimbibed a small tincture of those different sciences which his master\npretended to teach. In short, he resembled those vagrant swallows that\nskim along the level of some pool or river, without venturing to wet\none feather in their wings, except in the accidental pursuit of an\ninconsiderable fly. Yet, though his capacity or inclination was\nunsuited for studies of this kind, he did not fail to manifest a\nperfect genius in the acquisition of other more profitable arts. Over\nand above the accomplishments of address, for which he hath been\nalready celebrated, he excelled all his fellows in his dexterity at\nfives and billiards; was altogether unrivalled in his skill at draughts\nand backgammon; began, even at these years, to understand the moves and\nschemes of chess; and made himself a mere adept in the mystery of\ncards, which he learned in the course of his assiduities and attention\nto the females of the house.CHAPTER SIXHE MEDITATES SCHEMES OF IMPORTANCE.It was in these parties that he attracted the notice and friendship of\nhis patron’s daughter, a girl by two years older than himself, who was\nnot insensible to his qualifications, and looked upon him with the most\nfavourable eyes of prepossession. Whether or not he at this period of\nhis life began to project plans for availing himself of her\nsusceptibility, is uncertain; but, without all doubt, he cultivated her\nesteem with as obsequious and submissive attention as if he had already\nformed the design, which, in his advanced age, he attempted to put in\nexecution."

Such connexions naturally produce intimacy and\nfriendship. Fathom’s person was agreeable, his talents calculated for\nthe meridian of those parties, and his manners so engaging, that there\nwould have been no just subject for wonder, had he made an impression\nupon the tender unexperienced heart of Mademoiselle de Melvil, whose\nbeauty was not so attractive as to extinguish his hope, in raising up a\nnumber of formidable rivals; though her expectations of fortune were\nsuch as commonly lend additional lustre to personal merit.All these considerations were so many steps towards the success of\nFerdinand’s pretensions; and though he cannot be supposed to have\nperceived them at first, he in the sequel seemed perfectly well\napprised of his advantages, and used them to the full extent of his\nfaculties. Observing that she delighted in music, he betook himself to\nthe study of that art, and, by dint of application and a tolerable ear,\nlearned of himself to accompany her with a German flute, while she sung\nand played upon the harpsichord. The Count, seeing his inclination, and\nthe progress he had made, resolved that his capacity should not be lost\nfor want of cultivation; and accordingly provided him with a master, by\nwhom he was instructed in the principles of the art, and soon became a\nproficient in playing upon the violin."

He had before this time been smit with the ambition of making a\nconquest of the young lady’s heart, and foresaw manifold advantages to\nhimself in becoming son-in-law to Count Melvil, who, he never doubted,\nwould soon be reconciled to the match, if once it could be effectuated\nwithout his knowledge. Although he thought he had great reason to\nbelieve that Mademoiselle looked upon him with an eye of peculiar\nfavour, his disposition was happily tempered with an ingredient of\ncaution, that hindered him from acting with precipitation; and he had\ndiscerned in the young lady’s deportment certain indications of\nloftiness and pride, which kept him in the utmost vigilance and\ncircumspection; for he knew, that, by a premature declaration, he\nshould run the risk of forfeiting all the advantages he had gained, and\nblasting those expectations that now blossomed so gaily in his heart.Restricted by these reflections, he acted at a wary distance, and\ndetermined to proceed by the method of sap, and, summoning all his\nartifice and attractions to his aid, employed them under the insidious\ncover of profound respect, in order to undermine those bulwarks of\nhaughtiness or discretion, which otherwise might have rendered his\napproaches to her impracticable. With a view to enhance the value of\nhis company, and sound her sentiments at the same time, he became more\nreserved than usual, and seldomer engaged in her parties of music and\ncards; yet, in the midst of his reserve, he never failed in those\ndemonstrations of reverence and regard, which he knew perfectly well\nhow to express, but devised such excuses for his absence, as she could\nnot help admitting. In consequence of this affected shyness, she more\nthan once gently chid him for his neglect and indifference, observing,\nwith an ironical air, that he was now too much of a man to be\nentertained with such effeminate diversions; but her reproofs were\npronounced with too much ease and good-humour to be agreeable to our\nhero, who desired to see her ruffled and chagrined at his absence, and\nto hear himself rebuked with an angry affectation of disdain. This\neffort, therefore, he reinforced with the most captivating carriage he\ncould assume, in those hours which he now so sparingly bestowed upon\nhis mistress. He regaled her with all the entertaining stories he could\nlearn or invent, particularly such as he thought would justify and\nrecommend the levelling power of love, that knows no distinctions of\nfortune. He sung nothing but tender airs and passionate complaints,\ncomposed by desponding or despairing swains; and, to render his\nperformances of this kind the more pathetic, interlarded them with some\nseasonable sighs, while the tears, which he had ever at command, stood\ncollected in either eye."

  "content": "It was impossible for her to overlook such studied emotions; she in a\njocose manner taxed him with having lost his heart, rallied the excess\nof his passion, and in a merry strain undertook to be an advocate for\nhis love. Her behaviour was still wide of his wish and expectation. He\nthought she would, in consequence of her discovery, have betrayed some\ninterested symptom; that her face would have undergone some favourable\nsuffusion; that her tongue would have faltered, her breast heaved, and\nher whole deportment betokened internal agitation and disorder, in\nwhich case, he meant to profit by the happy impression, and declare\nhimself, before she could possibly recollect the dictates of her\npride.—Baffled however in his endeavours, by the serenity of the young\nlady, which he still deemed equivocal, he had recourse to another\nexperiment, by which he believed he should make a discovery of her\nsentiments beyond all possibility of doubt. One day, while he\naccompanied Mademoiselle in her exercise of music, he pretended all of\na sudden to be taken ill, and counterfeited a swoon in her apartment.\nSurprised at this accident, she screamed aloud, but far from running to\nhis assistance, with the transports and distraction of a lover, she\nordered her maid, who was present, to support his head, and went in\nperson to call for more help. He was accordingly removed to his own\nchamber, where, willing to be still more certified of her inclinations,\nhe prolonged the farce, and lay groaning under the pretence of a severe\nfever.The whole family was alarmed upon this occasion; for, as we have\nalready observed, he was an universal favourite. He was immediately\nvisited by the old Count and his lady, who expressed the utmost concern\nat his distemper, ordered him to be carefully attended, and sent for a\nphysician without loss of time. The young gentleman would scarce stir\nfrom his bedside, where he ministered unto him with all the\ndemonstrations of brotherly affection; and Miss exhorted him to keep up\nhis spirits, with many expressions of unreserved sympathy and regard.\nNevertheless, he saw nothing in her behaviour but what might be\nnaturally expected from common friendship, and a compassionate\ndisposition, and was very much mortified at his disappointment."

He was blooded, vomited, purged, and blistered, in the\nusual forms (for the physicians of Hungary are generally as well\nskilled in the arts of their occupation as any other leeches under the\nsun), and swallowed a whole dispensary of bolusses, draughts, and\napozems, by which means he became fairly delirious in three days, and\nso untractable, that he could be no longer managed according to rule;\notherwise, in all likelihood, the world would never have enjoyed the\nbenefit of these adventures. In short, his constitution, though unable\nto cope with two such formidable antagonists as the doctor and the\ndisease he had conjured up, was no sooner rid of the one, than it\neasily got the better of the other; and though Ferdinand, after all,\nfound his grand aim unaccomplished, his malady was productive of a\nconsequence, which, though he had not foreseen it, he did not fail to\nconvert to his own use and advantage.CHAPTER SEVENENGAGES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A FEMALE ASSOCIATE, IN ORDER TO PUT HIS\nTALENTS IN ACTION.While he displayed his qualifications in order to entrap the heart of\nhis young mistress, he had unwittingly enslaved the affections of her\nmaid. This attendant was also a favourite of the young lady, and,\nthough her senior by two or three good years at least, unquestionably\nher superior in point of personal beauty; she moreover possessed a good\nstock of cunning and discernment, and was furnished by nature with a\nvery amorous complexion. These circumstances being premised, the reader\nwill not be surprised to find her smitten by those uncommon\nqualifications which we have celebrated in young Fathom. She had in\ngood sooth long sighed in secret, under the powerful influence of his\ncharms, and practised upon him all those little arts, by which a woman\nstrives to attract the admiration, and ensnare the heart of a man she\nloves; but all his faculties were employed upon the plan which he had\nalready projected; that was the goal of his whole attention, to which\nall his measures tended; and whether or not he perceived the impression\nhe had made upon Teresa, he never gave her the least reason to believe\nhe was conscious of his victory, until he found himself baffled in his\ndesign upon the heart of her mistress.—She therefore persevered in her\ndistant attempts to allure him, with the usual coquetries of dress and\naddress, and, in the sweet hope of profiting by his susceptibility,\nmade shift to suppress her feelings, and keep her passion within\nbounds, until his supposed danger alarmed her fears, and raised such a\ntumult within her breast, that she could no longer conceal her love,\nbut gave a loose to her sorrow in the most immoderate expressions of\nanguish and affliction, and, while his delirium lasted, behaved with\nall the agitation of a despairing shepherdess."

  "content": "Ferdinand was, or pretended to be, the last person in the family who\nunderstood the situation of her thoughts; when he perceived her\npassion, he entered into deliberation with himself, and tasked his\nreflection and foresight, in order to discover how best he might\nconvert this conquest to his own advantage. Here, then, that we may\nneglect no opportunity of doing justice to our hero, it will be proper\nto observe, that, howsoever unapt his understanding might be to receive\nand retain the usual culture of the schools, he was naturally a genius\nself-taught, in point of sagacity and invention.—He dived into the\ncharacters of mankind, with a penetration peculiar to himself, and, had\nhe been admitted as a pupil in any political academy, would have\ncertainly become one of the ablest statesmen in Europe.Having revolved all the probable consequences of such a connexion, he\ndetermined to prosecute an amour with the lady whose affection he had\nsubdued; because he hoped to interest her as an auxiliary in his grand\nscheme upon Mademoiselle, which he did not as yet think proper to lay\naside; for he was not more ambitious in the plan, than indefatigable in\nthe prosecution of it. He knew it would be impossible to execute his\naims upon the Count’s daughter under the eye of Teresa, whose natural\ndiscernment would be whetted with jealousy, and who would watch his\nconduct, and thwart his progress with all the vigilance and spite of a\nslighted maiden. On the other hand, he did not doubt of being able to\nbring her over to his interest, by the influence he had already gained,\nor might afterwards acquire over her passions; in which case, she would\neffectually espouse his cause, and employ her good offices with her\nmistress in his behalf; besides, he was induced by another motive,\nwhich, though secondary, did not fail in this case to have an effect\nupon his determination. He looked upon Teresa with the eyes of\nappetite, which he longed to gratify; for he was not at all dead to the\ninstigations of the flesh, though he had philosophy enough to resist\nthem, when he thought they interfered with his interest. Here the case\nwas quite different. His desire happened to be upon the side of his\nadvantage, and therefore, resolving to indulge it, he no sooner found\nhimself in a condition to manage such an adventure, than he began to\nmake gradual advances in point of warmth and particular complacency to\nthe love-sick maid."

Although her heart was too\nmuch intendered to hold out against all the forms of assault, far from\nyielding at discretion, she stood upon honourable terms, with great\nobstinacy of punctilio, and, while she owned he was master of her\ninclinations, gave him to understand, with a peremptory and resolute\nair, that he should never make a conquest of her virtue; observing,\nthat, if the passion he professed was genuine, he would not scruple to\ngive such a proof of it as would at once convince her of his sincerity;\nand that he could have no just cause to refuse her that satisfaction,\nshe being his equal in point of birth and situation; for, if he was the\ncompanion and favourite of the young Count, she was the friend and\nconfidant of Mademoiselle.He acknowledged the strength of her argument, and that her\ncondescension was greater than his deserts, but objected against the\nproposal, as infinitely prejudicial to the fortunes of them both. He\nrepresented the state of dependence in which they mutually stood; their\nutter incapacity to support one another under the consequences of a\nprecipitate match, clandestinely made, without the consent and\nconcurrence of their patrons. He displayed, with great eloquence, all\nthose gay expectations they had reason to entertain, from that eminent\ndegree of favour which they had already secured in the family; and set\nforth, in the most alluring colours, those enchanting scenes of\npleasure they might enjoy in each other, without that disagreeable\nconsciousness of a nuptial chain, provided she would be his associate\nin the execution of a plan which he had projected for their reciprocal\nconvenience.Having thus inflamed her love of pleasure and curiosity, he, with great\ncaution, hinted his design upon the young lady’s fortune, and,\nperceiving her listening with the most greedy attention, and perfectly\nripe for the conspiracy, he disclosed his intention at full length,\nassuring her, with the most solemn protestations of love and\nattachment, that, could he once make himself legal possessor of an\nestate which Mademoiselle inherited by the will of a deceased aunt, his\ndear Teresa should reap the happy fruits of his affluence, and wholly\nengross his time and attention.Such a base declaration our hero would not have ventured to make, had\nhe not implicitly believed the damsel was as great a latitudinarian as\nhimself, in point of morals and principle; and been well assured, that,\nthough he should be mistaken in her way of thinking, so far as to be\nthreatened with a detection of his purpose, he would always have it in\nhis power to refute her accusation as mere calumny, by the character he\nhad hitherto maintained, and the circumspection of his future conduct."

  "content": "He seldom or never erred in his observations on the human heart.\nTeresa, instead of disapproving, relished the plan in general, with\ndemonstrations of singular satisfaction. She at once conceived all the\nadvantageous consequences of such a scheme, and perceived in it only\none flaw, which, however, she did not think incurable. This defect was\nno other than a sufficient bond of union, by which they might be\neffectually tied down to their mutual interest. She foresaw, that, in\ncase Ferdinand should obtain possession of the prize, he might, with\ngreat ease, deny their contract, and disavow her claim of\nparticipation. She therefore demanded security, and proposed, as a\npreliminary of the agreement, that he should privately take her to\nwife, with a view to dispel all her apprehensions of his inconstancy or\ndeceit, as such a previous engagement would be a check upon his\nbehaviour, and keep him strictly to the letter of their contract.He could not help subscribing to the righteousness of this proposal,\nwhich, nevertheless, he would have willingly waived, on the supposition\nthat they could not possibly be joined in the bands of wedlock with\nsuch secrecy as the nature of the case absolutely required. This would\nhave been a difficulty soon removed, had the scene of the transaction\nbeen laid in the metropolis of England, where passengers are plied in\nthe streets by clergymen, who prostitute their characters and\nconsciences for hire, in defiance of all decency and law; but in the\nkingdom of Hungary, ecclesiastics are more scrupulous in the exercise\nof their function, and the objection was, or supposed to be, altogether\ninsurmountable; so that they were fain to have recourse to an\nexpedient, with which, after some hesitation, our she-adventurer was\nsatisfied. They joined hands in the sight of Heaven, which they called\nto witness, and to judge the sincerity of their vows, and engaged, in a\nvoluntary oath, to confirm their union by the sanction of the church,\nwhenever a convenient opportunity for so doing should occur."

  "content": "The scruples of Teresa being thus removed, she admitted Ferdinand to\nthe privileges of a husband, which he enjoyed in stolen interviews, and\nreadily undertook to exert her whole power in promoting his suit with\nher young mistress, because she now considered his interest as\ninseparably connected with her own. Surely nothing could be more absurd\nor preposterous than the articles of this covenant, which she insisted\nupon with such inflexibility. How could she suppose that her pretended\nlover would be restrained by an oath, when the very occasion of\nincurring it was an intention to act in violation of all laws human and\ndivine? and yet such ridiculous conjuration is commonly the cement of\nevery conspiracy, how dark, how treacherous, how impious soever it may\nbe: a certain sign that there are some remains of religion left in the\nhuman mind, even after every moral sentiment hath abandoned it; and\nthat the most execrable ruffian finds means to quiet the suggestions of\nhis conscience, by some reversionary hope of Heaven’s forgiveness.CHAPTER EIGHTTHEIR FIRST ATTEMPT; WITH A DIGRESSION WHICH SOME READERS MAY THINK\nIMPERTINENT.Be this as it will, our lovers, though real voluptuaries, amidst the\nfirst transports of their enjoyment did not neglect the great political\naim of their conjunction. Teresa’s bedchamber, to which our hero\nconstantly repaired at midnight, was the scene of their deliberations,\nand there it was determined that the damsel, in order to avoid\nsuspicion, should feign herself irritated at the indifference of\nFerdinand, her passion for whom was by this time no secret in the\nfamily; and that, with a view to countenance this affectation, he\nshould upon all occasions treat her with an air of loftiness and\ndisdain.So screened from all imputation of fraud, she was furnished by him with\nartful instructions how to sound the inclinations of her young\nmistress, how to recommend his person and qualifications by the sure\nmethods of contradiction, comparisons, revilings, and reproach; how to\nwatch the paroxysms of her disposition, inflame her passions, and\nimprove, for his advantage, those moments of frailty from which no\nwoman is exempted. In short, this consummate politician taught his\nagent to poison the young lady’s mind with insidious conversation,\ntending to inspire her with the love of guilty pleasure, to debauch her\nsentiments, and confound her ideas of dignity and virtue. After all,\nthe task is not difficult to lead the unpractised heart astray, by dint\nof those opportunities her seducer possessed. The seeds of insinuation\nseasonably sown upon the warm luxuriant soil of youth, could hardly\nfail of shooting up into such intemperate desires as he wanted to\nproduce, especially when cultured and cherished in her unguarded hours,\nby that stimulating discourse which familiarity admits, and the looser\npassions, ingrafted in every breast, are apt to relish and excuse."
