  "content": "During this transaction, Farrel had well-nigh lost his life by the\nsavage behaviour of Trebasi’s attendant, who had been a hussar officer,\nand who, thinking it was his duty to imitate the example of his patron\non this occasion, discharged a pistol at the Major, before he had the\nleast intimation of his design. The Hibernian’s horse being a common\nhireling, and unaccustomed to stand fire, no sooner saw the flash of\nTrebasi’s pistol, than, starting aside, he happened to plunge into a\nhole, and was overturned at the very instant when the hussar’s piece\nwent off, so that no damage ensued to his rider, who, pitching on his\nfeet, flew with great nimbleness to his adversary, then, laying hold on\none leg, dismounted him in a twinkling, and, seizing his throat as he\nlay, would have soon despatched him without the use of firearms, had he\nnot been prevented by his friend Renaldo, who desired him to desist,\nobserving that his vengeance was already satisfied, as the Count seemed\nto be in the agonies of death. The Major was loth to quit his prey, as\nhe thought his aggressor had acted in a treacherous manner; but\nrecollecting that there was no time to lose, because, in all\nprobability, the firing had alarmed the castle, he took his leave of\nthe vanquished hussar, with a couple of hearty kicks, and, mounting his\nhorse, followed Melvil to the house of a gentleman in the\nneighbourhood, who was kinsman to the Countess, and very well disposed\nto grant him a secure retreat, until the troublesome consequences of\nthis rencontre should be overblown.Trebasi, though to the young gentleman he seemed speechless and\ninsensible, had neither lost the use of his reason nor of his tongue,\nbut affected that extremity, in order to avoid any further conversation\nwith the victor. He was one of those people who never think of death\nuntil he knocks at the door, and then earnestly entreat him to excuse\nthem for the present, and be so good as to call another time. The Count\nhad so often escaped unhurt, in the course of his campaigns, that he\nlooked upon himself as invulnerable, and set all danger at defiance.\nThough he had hitherto taken no care of the concerns of his soul, he\nhad a large fund of superstition at bottom; and, when the surgeon, who\nexamined his wound, declared it was mortal, all the terrors of futurity\ntook hold on his imagination, all the misdemeanours of his life\npresented themselves in aggravated colours to his recollection.He implored the spiritual assistance of a good priest in the\nneighbourhood, who, in the discharge of his own conscience, gave him to\nunderstand that he had little mercy to expect, unless he would, as much\nas lay in his power, redress the injuries he had done to his\nfellow-creatures. As nothing lay heavier upon his soul than the cruelty\nand fraud he had practised upon the family of Count Melvil, he\nearnestly besought this charitable clergyman to mediate his pardon with\nthe Countess, and at the same time desired to see Renaldo before his\ndeath, that he might put him in possession of his paternal estate, and\nsolicit his forgiveness for the offence he had given."

Her son gladly obeyed the summons, and was\nreceived with great civility and satisfaction by his father-in-law,\nwho, in presence of the judge and divers gentlemen assembled for that\npurpose, renounced all right and title to the fortune he had so\nunjustly usurped; disclosed the name of the convent to which\nMademoiselle de Melvil had been conveyed, dismissed all the agents of\nhis iniquity, and being reconciled to his son-in-law, began to prepare\nhimself in tranquillity for his latter end.The Countess was overwhelmed with an excess of joy, while she embraced\nher long-lost son, who had proved himself so worthy of his father. Yet\nthis joy was embittered, by reflecting that she was made a widow by the\nhands of that darling son. For, though she knew his honour demanded the\nsacrifice, she could not lay aside that regard and veneration which is\nattached to the name of husband; and therefore resolved to retire into\na monastery, where she could spend the remainder of her life in\ndevotion, without being exposed to any intercourse which might\ninterfere with the delicacy of her sentiments on that subject.CHAPTER FIFTY-NINEHE IS THE MESSENGER OF HAPPINESS TO HIS SISTER, WHO REMOVES THE FILM\nWHICH HAD LONG OBSTRUCTED HIS PENETRATION, WITH REGARD TO COUNT FATHOM.As the most endearing affection had always subsisted between Renaldo\nand his sister, he would not one moment deny himself the pleasure of\nflying to her embrace, and of being the glad messenger of her\ndeliverance. Soon, therefore, as he understood the place of her\nretreat, and had obtained a proper order to the abbess, signed by Count\nTrebasi, he set out post for Vienna, still accompanied by his faithful\nHibernian, and, arriving at the convent, found the abbess and the whole\nhouse so engrossed in making preparations for the ceremony of giving\nthe veil next day to a young woman who had fulfilled the term of her\nprobation, that he could not possibly see his sister with that leisure\nand satisfaction which he had flattered himself with enjoying at this\nmeeting; and therefore he was fain to bridle his impatience for two\ndays, and keep his credentials until the hurry should be over, that\nMademoiselle might have no intimation of her good fortune, except from\nhis own mouth."

  "content": "In order to fill up this tedious interval, he visited his friends at\ncourt, who were rejoiced to hear the happy issue of his excursion to\nPresburg; the prince, who was his particular patron, desired he would\nmake himself perfectly easy with regard to the death of Count Trebasi,\nfor he would take care to represent him in such a light to the\nempress-queen, as would screen him from any danger or prosecution on\nthat account. His highness, moreover, appointed the following day for\nperforming the promise he had made of presenting him to that august\nprincess, and in the meantime prepossessed her so much in his favour,\nthat when he approached her presence, and was announced by his noble\nintroductor, she eyed him with a look of peculiar complacency, saying,\n“I am glad to see you returned to my dominions. Your father was a\ngallant officer, who served our house with equal courage and fidelity;\nand as I understand you tread in his footsteps, you may depend upon my\nfavour and protection.”He was so much overwhelmed with this gracious reception, that, while he\nbowed in silence, the drops of gratitude trickled from his eyes; and\nher imperial majesty was so well pleased with this manifestation of his\nheart, that she immediately gave directions for promoting him to the\ncommand of a troop of horse. Thus fortune seemed willing, and indeed\neager to discharge the debt she owed him for the different calamities\nhe had undergone. And as he looked upon the generous Hebrew to be the\nsole source of his success, he did not fail to make him acquainted with\nthe happy effects of his recommendation and friendship, and to express,\nin the warmest terms, the deep sense he had of his uncommon\nbenevolence, which, by the bye, was still greater, with regard to\nRenaldo, than the reader as yet imagines; for he not only furnished him\nwith money for his present occasions, but also gave him an unlimited\ncredit on a banker in Vienna, to whom one of his letters was directed.The ceremony of the nun’s admission being now performed, and the\nconvent restored to its former quiet, Melvil hastened thither on the\nwings of brotherly affection, and presented his letter to the abbess,\nwho having perused the contents, by which she learned that the family\ndisquiets of Count Trebasi no longer subsisted, and that the bearer was\nthe brother of Mademoiselle, she received him with great politeness,\ncongratulated him on this happy event, and, begging he would excuse her\nstaying with him in the parlour, on pretence of business, withdrew,\nsaying, she would immediately send in a young lady who would console\nhim for her absence. In a few minutes he was joined by his sister, who,\nexpecting nothing less than to see Renaldo, no sooner distinguished his\nfeatures, than she shrieked aloud with surprise, and would have sunk\nupon the floor, had not he supported her in his embrace."

  "content": "Such a sudden apparition of her brother at any time, or in any place,\nafter their long separation, would have strongly affected this sensible\nyoung lady; but to find him so abruptly in a place where she thought\nherself buried from the knowledge of all her relations, occasioned such\ncommotions in her spirits as had well-nigh endangered her reason. For\nit was not till after a considerable pause, that she could talk to him\nwith connexion or coherence. However, as those transports subsided,\nthey entered into a more deliberate and agreeable conversation; in the\ncourse of which, he gradually informed her of what had passed at the\ncastle; and inexpressible was the pleasure she felt in learning that\nher mother was released from captivity, herself restored to freedom,\nand her brother to the possession of his inheritance, by the only means\nto which she had always prayed these blessings might be owing.As she had been treated with uncommon humanity by the abbess, she would\nnot consent to leave the convent until he should be ready to set out\nfor Presburg; so that they dined together with that good lady, and\npassed the afternoon in that mutual communication with which a brother\nand sister may be supposed to entertain themselves on such an occasion.\nShe gave him a detail of the insults and mortifications she had\nsuffered from the brutality of her father-in-law, and told him, that\nher confinement in this monastery was owing to Trebasi having\nintercepted a letter to her from Renaldo, signifying his intention to\nreturn to the empire, in order to assert his own right, and redress his\ngrievances. Then turning the discourse upon the incidents of his\nperegrinations, she in a particular manner inquired about that\nexquisite beauty who had been the innocent source of all his\ndistresses, and upon whose perfections he had often, in his letters to\nhis sister, expatiated with indications of rapture and delight."

  "content": "This inquiry in a moment blew up that scorching flame which had been\nwell-nigh stifled by other necessary avocations. His eyes gleamed, his\ncheeks glowed and grew pale alternately, and his whole frame underwent\nan immediate agitation; which being perceived by Mademoiselle, she\nconcluded that some new calamity was annexed to the name of Monimia,\nand, dreading to rip up a wound which she saw was so ineffectually\nclosed, she for the present suppressed her curiosity and concern, and\nindustriously endeavoured to introduce some less affecting subject of\nconversation. He saw her aim, approved of her discretion, and, joining\nher endeavours, expressed his surprise at her having omitted to signify\nthe least remembrance of her old favourite, Fathom, whom he had left in\nEngland. He had no sooner pronounced this name, than she suffered some\nconfusion in her turn; from which, however, recollecting herself,\n“Brother,” said she, “you must endeavour to forget that wretch, who is\naltogether unworthy of retaining the smallest share of your regard.”Astonished, and indeed angry, at this expression, which he considered\nas the effect of malicious misrepresentation, he gently chid her for\nher credulity in believing the envious aspersion of some person, who\nrepined at the superior virtue of Fathom, whom he affirmed to be an\nhonour to the human species.“Nothing is more easy,” replied the young lady, “than to impose upon a\nperson, who, being himself unconscious of guile, suspects no deceit.\nYou have been a dupe, dear brother, not to the finesse of Fathom, but\nto the sincerity of your own heart. For my own part, I assume no honour\nto my own penetration in having comprehended the villany of that\nimpostor, which was discovered, in more than one instance, by accidents\nI could not possibly foresee.“You must know, that Teresa, who attended me from my childhood, and in\nwhose honesty I reposed such confidence, having disobliged some of the\ninferior servants, was so narrowly watched in all her transactions, as\nto be at last detected in the very act of conveying a piece of plate,\nwhich was actually found concealed among her clothes.“You may guess how much I was astonished when I understood this\ncircumstance. I could not trust to the evidence of my own senses, and\nshould have still believed her innocent, in spite of ocular\ndemonstration, had not she, in the terrors of being tried for felony,\npromised to make a very material discovery to the Countess, provided\nshe would take such measures as would save her life."

  "content": "“This request being complied with, she, in my hearing, opened up such\nan amazing scene of iniquity, baseness, and ingratitude, which had been\nacted by her and Fathom, in order to defraud the family to which they\nwere so much indebted, that I could not have believed the human mind\ncapable of such degeneracy, or that traitor endowed with such\npernicious cunning and dissimulation, had not her tale been congruous,\nconsistent, and distinct, and fraught with circumstances that left no\nroom to doubt the least article of her confession; on consideration of\nwhich she was permitted to go into voluntary exile.”She then explained their combination in all the particulars, as we have\nalready recounted them in their proper place, and finally observed,\nthat the opinion she had hence conceived of Fathom’s character, was\nconfirmed by what she had since learned of his perfidious conduct\ntowards that very nun who had lately taken the veil.Perceiving her brother struck dumb with astonishment, and gaping with\nthe most eager attention, she proceeded to relate the incidents of his\ndouble intrigue with the jeweller’s wife and daughter, as they were\ncommunicated to her by the nun, who was no other than the individual\nWilhelmina. After those rivals had been forsaken by their gallant,\ntheir mutual animosities and chagrin served to whet the attention and\ninvention of each; so that in a little time the whole mystery stood\ndisclosed to both. The mother had discovered the daughter’s\ncorrespondence with Fathom, as we have formerly observed, by means of\nthat unfortunate letter which he unwittingly committed to the charge of\nthe old beldame; and, as soon as she understood he was without the\nreach of all solicitation or prosecution, imparted this billet to her\nhusband, whose fury was so ungovernable, that he had almost sacrificed\nWilhelmina with his own hands, especially when, terrified by his\nthreats and imprecations, she owned that she had bestowed the chain on\nthis perfidious lover. However, this dreadful purpose was prevented,\npartly by the interposition of his wife, whose aim was not the death\nbut immurement of his daughter, and partly by the tears and\nsupplication of the young gentlewoman herself, who protested, that,\nalthough the ceremony of the church had not been performed, she was\ncontracted to Fathom by the most solemn vows, to witness which he\ninvoked all the saints in heaven."

  "content": "The jeweller, upon cooler consideration, was unwilling to lose the last\nspark of hope that glittered among the ruins of his despair, and\nresisted all the importunities of his wife, who pressed him to consult\nthe welfare of his daughter’s soul, in the fond expectation of finding\nsome expedient to lure back the chain and its possessor. In the\nmeantime Wilhelmina was daily and hourly exposed to the mortifying\nanimadversions of her mamma, who, with all the insolence of virtue,\nincessantly upbraided her with the backslidings of her vicious life,\nand exhorted her to reformation and repentance. This continual triumph\nlasted for many months, till at length, a quarrel happening between the\nmother and the gossip at whose house she used to give the rendezvous to\nher admirers, that incensed confidante, in the precipitation of her\nanger, promulgated the history of those secret meetings; and, among the\nrest, her interviews with Fathom were brought to light.The first people who hear news of this sort are generally those to whom\nthey are most unwelcome. The German was soon apprised of his wife’s\nfrailty, and considered the two females of his house as a couple of\ndevils incarnate, sent from hell to exercise his patience. Yet, in the\nmidst of his displeasure, he found matter of consolation, in being\nfurnished with a sufficient reason for parting with his helpmate, who\nhad for many years kept his family in disquiet. He therefore, without\nhazarding a personal conference, sent proposals to her by a friend,\nwhich she did not think proper to reject; and seeing himself restored\nto the dominion of his own house, exerted his sway so tyrannically,\nthat Wilhelmina became weary of her life, and had recourse to the\ncomforts of religion, of which she soon became enamoured, and begged\nher father’s permission to dedicate the rest of her life to the duties\nof devotion. She was accordingly received in this convent, the\nregulations of which were so much to her liking, that she performed the\ntask of probation with pleasure, and voluntarily excluded herself from\nthe vanities of this life. It was here she had contracted an\nacquaintance with Mademoiselle de Melvil, to whom she communicated her\ncomplaints of Fathom, on the supposition that he was related to the\nCount, as he himself had often declared.While the young lady rehearsed the particulars of this detail, Renaldo\nsustained a strange vicissitude of different passions. Surprise,\nsorrow, fear, hope, and indignation raised a most tumultuous conflict\nin his bosom. Monimia rushed upon his imagination in the character of\ninnocence betrayed by the insinuations of treachery. He with horror\nviewed her at the mercy of a villain, who had broken all the ties of\ngratitude and honour."

Have I listened to the voice of a\ntraitor, who hath murdered my peace! who hath torn my heart-strings\nasunder, and perhaps ruined the pattern of all earthly perfection. It\ncannot be. Heaven would not suffer such infernal artifice to take\neffect. The thunder would be levelled against the head of the accursed\nprojector.”From this transport, compared with his agitation when he mentioned\nMonimia, his sister judged that Fathom had been the occasion of a\nbreach between the two lovers; and this conjecture being confirmed by\nthe disjointed answers he made to her interrogations upon the affair,\nshe endeavoured to calm his apprehensions, by representing that he\nwould soon have an opportunity of returning to England, where the\nmisunderstanding might be easily cleared up; and that, in the meantime,\nhe had nothing to fear on account of the person of his mistress, in a\ncountry where individuals were so well protected by the laws and\nconstitution of the realm. At length he suffered himself to be\nflattered with the fond hope of seeing Monimia’s character triumph in\nthe inquiry, of retrieving that lost jewel, and of renewing that\nravishing intercourse and exalted expectation which had been so cruelly\ncut off. He now wished to find Fathom as black as he had been\nexhibited, that Monimia’s apostasy might be numbered among the\nmisrepresentations of his treachery and fraud.His love, which was alike generous and ardent, espoused the cause, and\nhe no longer doubted her constancy and virtue. But when he reflected\nhow her tender heart must have been wrung with anguish at his\nunkindness and cruelty, in leaving her destitute in a foreign land; how\nher sensibility must have been tortured in finding herself altogether\ndependent upon a ruffian, who certainly harboured the most baleful\ndesigns upon her honour; how her life must be endangered both by his\nbarbarity and her own despair—I say, when he reflected on these\ncircumstances, he shuddered with horror and dismay; and that very night\ndespatched a letter to his friend the Jew, entreating him, in the most\npressing manner, to employ all his intelligence in learning the\nsituation of the fair orphan, that she might be protected from the\nvillany of Fathom, until his return to England.CHAPTER SIXTY"

He soothed himself with the prospect of a happy\nreconciliation with the divine Monimia, and his fancy was decoyed from\nevery disagreeable presage by the entertaining conversation of his\nsister, with whom in two days he set out for Presburg, attended by his\nfriend the Major, who had never quitted him since their meeting at\nBrussels. Here they found Count Trebasi entirely rid of the fever which\nhad been occasioned by his wound, and in a fair way of doing well; a\ncircumstance that afforded unspeakable pleasure to Melvil, whose manner\nof thinking was such, as would have made him unhappy, could he have\ncharged himself with the death of his mother’s husband, howsoever\ncriminal he might have been.The Count’s ferocity did not return with his health. His eyes were\nopened by the danger he had incurred, and his sentiments turned in a\nnew channel. He heartily asked pardon of Mademoiselle for the rigorous\nusage she had suffered from the violence of his temper; thanked Renaldo\nfor the seasonable lesson he had administered to him; and not only\ninsisted upon being removed from the castle to a house of his own in\nPresburg, but proffered to make immediate restitution of all the rents\nwhich he had unjustly converted to his own use."

But, before\nhe quitted Presburg, his friend Farrel taking him aside one day,\n“Count,” said he, “will you give me leave to ask, if, by my zeal and\nattachment for you, I have had the good fortune to acquire your\nesteem?” “To doubt that esteem,” replied Renaldo, “were to suspect my\ngratitude and honour, of which I must be utterly destitute before I\nlose the sense of those obligations I owe to your gallantry and\nfriendship—obligations which I long for a proper occasion to repay.”“Well then,” resumed the Major, “I will deal with you like a downright\nSwiss, and point out a method by which you may shift the load of\nobligation from your own shoulders to mine. You know my birth, rank,\nand expectations in the service; but perhaps you do not know, that, as\nmy expense has always unavoidably exceeded my income, I find myself a\nlittle out at elbows in my circumstances, and want to piece them up by\nmatrimony. Of those ladies with whom I think I have any chance of\nsucceeding, Mademoiselle de Melvil seems the best qualified to render\nmy situation happy in all respects. Her fortune is more than sufficient\nto disembarrass my affairs; her good sense will be a seasonable check\nupon my vivacity; her agreeable accomplishments will engage a\ncontinuation of affection and regard. I know my own disposition well\nenough to think I shall become a most dutiful and tractable husband;\nand shall deem myself highly honoured in being more closely united to\nmy dear Count de Melvil, the son and representative of that worthy\nofficer under whom my youth was formed. If you will therefore sanction\nmy claim, I will forthwith begin my approaches, and doubt not, under\nyour auspices, to bring the place to a capitulation.”"

Mademoiselle, who had never been exercised in the coquetries of\nher sex, and was now arrived at those years when the vanity of youth\nought to yield to discretion, considered the proposal as a philosopher,\nand after due deliberation candidly owned she had no objection to the\nmatch. Farrel was accordingly introduced in the character of a lover,\nafter the permission of the Countess had been obtained; and he carried\non his addresses in the usual form, so much to the satisfaction of all\nconcerned in the event, that a day was appointed for the celebration of\nhis nuptials, when he entered into peaceable possession of his prize.A few days after this joyful occasion, while Renaldo was at Vienna,\nwhere he had been indulged with leave of absence for six months, and\nemployed in making preparations for his journey to Britain, he was one\nevening presented by his servant with a package from London, which he\nno sooner opened, than he found enclosed a letter directed to him, in\nthe handwriting of Monimia. He was so much affected at sight of those\nwell-known characters, that he stood motionless as a statue, eager to\nknow the contents, yet afraid to peruse the billet. While he hesitated\nin this suspense, he chanced to cast his eye on the inside of the\ncover, and perceived the name of his Jewish friend at the bottom of a\nfew lines, importing, that the enclosed was delivered to him by a\nphysician of his acquaintance, who had recommended it in a particular\nmanner to his care. This intimation served only to increase the\nmystery, and whet his impatience; and as he had the explanation in his\nhand, he summoned all his resolution to his aid, and, breaking the\nseal, began to read these words: “Renaldo will not suppose that this\naddress proceeds from interested motives, when he learns, that, before\nit can be presented to his view, the unfortunate Monimia will be no\nmore.”"

But before\nthe Count exhibited any signs of life, his brother-in-law entered his\nchamber by accident, and as soon as he recollected himself from the\nextreme confusion and concern produced by this melancholy spectacle, he\nperceived the fatal epistle, which Melvil, though insensible, still\nkept within his grasp; justly suspecting this to be the cause of that\nsevere paroxysm, he drew near the couch, and with difficulty read what\nis above rehearsed, and the sequel, to this effect:—“Yes, I have taken such measures as will prevent it from falling into\nyour hands, until after I shall have been released from a being\nembittered with inexpressible misery and anguish. It is not my\nintention, once loved, and ah! still too fondly remembered youth, to\nupbraid you as the source of that unceasing woe which hath been so long\nthe sole inhabitant of my lonely bosom.

When he\nwas once more overcome by numbers, he cursed himself, and all those who\nwithheld him; swore he would not survive the fair victim who had\nperished by his credulity and indiscretion; and the agitation of his\nspirits increased to such a degree, that he was seized with strong\nconvulsions, which nature was scarce able to sustain. Every medical\nexpedient was used to quiet his perturbation, which at length yielded\nso far as to subside into a continual fever and confirmed delirium,\nduring which he ceased not to pour forth the most pathetic complaints,\ntouching his ruined love, and to rave about the ill-starred Monimia.\nThe Major, half distracted by the calamity of his friend, would have\nconcealed it from the knowledge of his family, had not the physician,\nby despairing of his life, laid him under the necessity of making them\nacquainted with his condition."

They saw his face distorted, and his eyes glaring with frenzy;\nthey heard him invoke the name of Monimia with a tenderness of accent\nwhich even the impulse of madness could not destroy. Then, with a\nsudden transition of tone and gesture, he denounced vengeance against\nher betrayer, and called upon the north wind to cool the fervour of his\nbrain. His hair hung in dishevelled parcels, his cheeks were wan, his\nlooks ghastly, his vigour was fled, and all the glory of his youth\nfaded; the physician hung his head in silence, the attendants wrung\ntheir hands in despair, and the countenance of his friend was bathed in\ntears.Such a picture would have moved the most obdurate heart; what\nimpression then must it have made upon a parent and sister, melting\nwith all the enthusiasm of affection! The mother was struck dumb, and\nstupefied with grief; the sister threw herself on the bed in a\ntransport of sorrow, caught her loved Renaldo in her arms, and was,\nwith great difficulty, torn from his embrace. Such was the dismal\nreverse that overtook the late so happy family of Melvil; such was the\nextremity to which the treachery of Fathom had reduced his best\nbenefactor!Three days did nature struggle with surprising efforts, and then the\nconstitution seemed to sink under the victorious fever; yet, as his\nstrength diminished, his delirium abated, and on the fifth morning he\nlooked round, and recognised his weeping friends. Though now exhausted\nto the lowest ebb of life, he retained the perfect use of speech, and\nhis reason being quite unclouded, spoke to each with equal kindness and\ncomposure; he congratulated himself upon the sight of shore after the\nhorrors of such a tempest; called upon the Countess and his sister, who\nwere not permitted to see him at such a conjuncture; and being apprised\nby the Major of his reason for excluding them from his presence, he\napplauded his concern, bequeathed them to his future care, and took\nleave of that gentleman with a cordial embrace. Then he desired to be\nleft in private with a certain clergyman, who regulated the concerns of\nhis soul, and he being dismissed, turned his face from the light, in\nexpectation of his final discharge. In a few minutes all was still and\ndreary, he was no longer heard to breathe, no more the stream of life\nwas perceived to circulate, he was supposed to be absolved from all his\ncares, and an universal groan from the bystanders announced the decease\nof the gallant, generous, and tender-hearted Renaldo."

This uncommon sensation he reported\nto the physician, who, though he could feel no pulsation of the heart\nor arteries, conjectured that life still lingered in some of its\ninterior haunts, and immediately ordered such applications to the\nextremities and surface of the body, as might help to concentrate and\nreinforce the natural heat.By these prescriptions, which for some time produced no sensible\neffect, the embers were, in all probability, kept glowing, and the\nvital power revived, for, after a considerable pause, respiration was\ngradually renewed at long intervals, a languid motion was perceived at\nthe heart, a few feeble and irregular pulsations were felt at the\nwrist, the clay-coloured livery of death began to vanish from his face,\nthe circulation acquired new force, and he opened his eyes with a sigh,\nwhich proclaimed his return from the shades of death.When he recovered the faculty of swallowing, a cordial was\nadministered, and whether the fever abated, in consequence of the\nblood’s being cooled and condensed during the recess of action in the\nsolids, or nature, in that agony, had prepared a proper channel for the\nexpulsion of the disease, certain it is, he was from this moment rid of\nall bodily pain; he retrieved the animal functions, and nothing\nremained of his malady but an extreme weakness and languor, the effect\nof nature’s being fatigued in the battle she had won."

Scarce\ncould they be restrained from pouring forth their transports in the\npresence of Renaldo, who was still too feeble to endure such\ncommunication; indeed, he was extremely mortified and dejected at this\nevent, which had diffused such pleasure and satisfaction among his\nfriends, for though his distemper was mastered, the fatal cause of it\nstill rankled at his heart, and he considered this respite from death\nas a protraction of his misery.When he was congratulated by the Major on the triumph of his\nconstitution, he replied, with a groan, “I would to heaven it had been\notherwise, for I am reserved for all the horrors of the most poignant\nsorrow and remorse. O Monimia! Monimia! I hoped by this time to have\nconvinced thy gentle shade, that I was, at least intentionally,\ninnocent of that ruthless barbarity which hath brought thee to an\nuntimely grave. Heaven and earth! do I still survive the consciousness\nof that dire catastrophe! and lives the atrocious villain who hath\nblasted all our hopes!”With these last words the fire darted from his eyes, and his brother,\nsnatching this occasional handle for reconciling him to life, joined in\nhis exclamations against the treacherous Fathom, and observed, that he\nshould not, in point of honour, wish to die, until he should have\nsacrificed that traitor to the manes of the beauteous Monimia. This\nincitement acted as a spur upon exhausted nature, causing the blood to\ncirculate with fresh vigour, and encouraging him to take such\nsustenance as would recruit his strength, and repair the damage which\nhis health had sustained.His sister assiduously attended him in his recovery, flattering his\nappetite, and amusing his sorrow at the same time; the clergyman\nassailed his despondence with religious weapons, as well as with\narguments drawn from philosophy; and the fury of his passions being\nalready expended, he became so tractable as to listen to his\nremonstrances. But notwithstanding the joint endeavours of all his\nfriends, a deep fixed melancholy remained after every consequence of\nhis disease had vanished. In vain they essayed to elude his grief by\ngaiety and diversions, in vain they tried to decoy his heart into some\nnew engagement."

  "content": "These kind attempts served only to feed and nourish that melancholy\nwhich pined within his bosom. Monimia still haunted him in the midst of\nthese amusements, while his reflection whispered to him, “Pleasures\nlike these I might have relished with her participation.” That darling\nidea mingled in all the female assemblies at which he was present,\neclipsing their attractions, and enhancing the bitterness of his loss;\nfor absence, enthusiasm, and even his despair had heightened the charms\nof the fair orphan into something supernatural and divine.Time, that commonly weakens the traces of remembrance, seemed to deepen\nits impressions in his breast; nightly, in his dreams, did he converse\nwith his dear Monimia, sometimes on the verdant bank of a delightful\nstream, where he breathed, in soft murmurs, the dictates of his love\nand admiration; sometimes reclined within the tufted grove, his arm\nencircled and sustained her snowy neck, whilst she, with looks of love\nineffable, gazed on his face, invoking Heaven to bless her husband and\nher lord. Yet, even in these illusions was his fancy oft alarmed for\nthe ill-fated fair. Sometimes he viewed her tottering on the brink of a\nsteep precipice, far distant from his helping hand; at other times she\nseemed to sail along the boisterous tide, imploring his assistance,\nthen would he start with horror from his sleep, and feel his sorrows\nmore than realised; he deserted his couch, he avoided the society of\nmankind, he courted sequestered shades where he could indulge his\nmelancholy; there his mind brooded over his calamity until his\nimagination became familiar with all the ravages of death; it\ncontemplated the gradual decline of Monimia’s health, her tears, her\ndistress, her despair at his imagined cruelty; he saw, through that\nperspective, every blossom of her beauty wither, every sparkle vanish\nfrom her eyes; he beheld her faded lips, her pale cheek, and her\ninanimated features, the symmetry of which not death itself was able to\ndestroy. His fancy conveyed her breathless corse to the cold grave,\no’er which, perhaps, no tear humane was shed, where her delicate limbs\nwere consigned to dust, where she was dished out a delicious banquet to\nthe unsparing worm."

Besides the prospect of this\ngloomy enjoyment, he was urged to return to England, by an eager desire\nof taking vengeance on the perfidious Fathom, as well as of acquitting\nhimself of the obligations he owed in that kingdom, to those who had\nassisted him in his distress. He therefore communicated his intention\nto Farrel, who would have insisted upon attending him in the journey,\nhad not he been conjured to stay and manage Renaldo’s affairs in his\nabsence. Every previous step being taken, he took leave of the Countess\nand his sister, who had, with all their interest and elocution, opposed\nhis design, the execution of which, they justly feared, would, instead\nof dissipating, augment his chagrin; and now, seeing him determined,\nthey shed a flood of tears at his departure, and he set out from Vienna\nin a post-chaise, accompanied by a trusty valet-de-chambre on\nhorseback.CHAPTER SIXTY-ONERENALDO MEETS WITH A LIVING MONUMENT OF JUSTICE, AND ENCOUNTERS A\nPERSONAGE OF SOME NOTE IN THESE MEMOIRS.As this domestic was very well qualified for making all the proper\ndispositions, and adjusting every necessary article on the road,\nRenaldo totally abstracted himself from earthly considerations, and\nmused without ceasing on that theme which was the constant subject of\nhis contemplation. He was blind to the objects that surrounded him; he\nscarce ever felt the importunities of nature; and had not they been\nreinforced by the pressing entreaties of his attendant, he would have\nproceeded without refreshment or repose. In this absence of mind did he\ntraverse a great part of Germany, in his way to the Austrian\nNetherlands, and arrived at the fortress of Luxemburg, where he was\nobliged to tarry a whole day on account of an accident which had\nhappened to his chaise. Here he went to view the fortifications; and as\nhe walked along the ramparts, his ears were saluted with these words:\n“Heaven bless the noble Count de Melvil! will not he turn the eyes of\ncompassion on an old fellow-soldier reduced to misfortune and\ndisgrace?”Surprised at this address, which was attended with the clanking of\nchains, Renaldo lifted up his eyes, and perceived the person who spoke\nto be one of two malefactors shackled together, who had been sentenced\nfor some crime to work as labourers on the fortifications. His face was\nso covered with hair, and his whole appearance so disguised by the\nsqualid habit which he wore, that the Count could not recollect his\nfeatures, until he gave him to understand that his name was Ratchcali.\nMelvil immediately recognised his fellow-student at Vienna, and his\nbrother-volunteer upon the Rhine, and expressed equal surprise and\nconcern at seeing him in such a deplorable situation."

Without betraying the least symptoms of\nshame or confusion, “Count,” says he, “this is the fate of war, at\nleast of the war in which I have been engaged, ever since I took leave\nof the Imperial army, and retreated with your old companion Fathom.\nLong life to that original genius! If he is not unhappily eclipsed by\nsome unfortunate interposition, before his terrene parts are purified,\nI foresee that he will shine a star of the first magnitude in the world\nof adventure.”At mention of this detested name, Renaldo’s heart began to throb with\nindignation; yet he suppressed the emotion, and desired to know the\nmeaning of that splendid encomium which he had bestowed upon his\nconfederate. “It would be quite unnecessary,” replied Ratchcali, “for a\nman in my present situation to equivocate or disguise the truth. The\nnature of my disgrace is perfectly well known. I am condemned to hard\nlabour for life; and unless some lucky accident, which I cannot now\nforesee, shall intervene, all I can expect is some alleviation of my\nhard lot from the generosity of such gentlemen as you, who\ncompassionate the sufferings of your fellow-creatures. In order to\nengage your benevolence the more in my behalf, I shall, if you will\ngive me the hearing, faithfully inform you of some particulars, which\nit may import you to know, concerning my old acquaintance Ferdinand\nCount Fathom, whose real character hath perhaps hitherto escaped your\nnotice.”Then he proceeded to give a regular detail of all the strokes of\nfinesse which he, in conjunction with our adventurer, had practised\nupon Melvil and others, during their residence at Vienna, and the\ncampaigns they had made upon the Rhine. He explained the nature of the\nrobbery which was supposed to have been done by the Count’s valet,\ntogether with the manner of their desertion. He described his\nseparation from Fathom, their meeting at London, the traffic they\ncarried on in copartnership; and the misfortune that reduced Ferdinand\nto the condition in which he was found by Melvil."

But, chancing to meet with an old acquaintance,\nwhom I did not at all desire to see, I found it convenient to withdraw\nsoftly to Rotterdam; from whence we set out for Antwerp; and, having\nmade a tour of the Austrian Netherlands, set up our rest at Brussels,\nand concerted a plan for laying the Flemings under contribution.“From our appearance we procured admission into the most polite\nassemblies, and succeeded to a wonder in all our operations; until our\ncareer was unfortunately checked by the indiscretion of my ally, who,\nbeing detected in the very act of conveying a card, was immediately\nintroduced to a magistrate. And this minister of justice was so\ncurious, inquisitive, and clear-sighted, that Count Maurice, finding it\nimpossible to elude his penetration, was fain to stipulate for his own\nsafety, by giving up his friend to the cognisance of the law. I was\naccordingly apprehended, before I knew the cause of my arrest; and\nbeing unhappily known by some soldiers of the Prince’s guard, my\ncharacter turned out so little to the approbation of the inquisitors,\nthat all my effects were confiscated for the benefit of the state, and\nI was by a formal sentence condemned to labour on the fortifications\nall the days of my life; while Maurice escaped at the expense of five\nhundred stripes, which he received in public from the hands of the\ncommon executioner.“Thus have I, without evasion or mental reservation, given a faithful\naccount of the steps by which I have arrived at this barrier, which is\nlikely to be the ne plus ultra of my peregrinations, unless the\ngenerous Count de Melvil will deign to interpose his interest in behalf\nof an old fellow-soldier, who may yet live to justify his mediation.”"
