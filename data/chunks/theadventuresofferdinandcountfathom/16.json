  "content": "The Count, with that warmth of sympathy and benevolence which was\nnatural to his heart, lifted up the wounded cavalier in his arms, and\ncarried him to the chaise, in which he was deposited, while the\nvalet-de-chambre reloaded his pistols, and prepared for a second\nattack, as they did not doubt that the banditti would return with a\nreinforcement. However, before they reappeared, Renaldo’s driver\ndisengaged him from the wood, and in less than a quarter of an hour\nthey arrived at a village, where they halted for assistance to the\nstranger, who, though still alive, had not recovered the use of his\nsenses.After he was undressed, and laid in a warm bed, a surgeon examined his\nbody, and found a wound in his neck by a sword, and another in his\nright side, occasioned by a pistol-shot; so that his prognostic was\nvery dubious. Meanwhile, he applied proper dressings to both; and, in\nhalf an hour after this administration, the gentleman gave some tokens\nof perception. He looked around him with a wildness of fury in his\naspect, as if he had thought himself in the hands of the robbers by\nwhom he had been attacked. But, when he saw the assiduity with which\nthe bystanders exerted themselves in his behalf, one raising his head\nfrom the pillow, while another exhorted him to swallow a little wine\nwhich was warmed for the purpose; when he beheld the sympathising looks\nof all present, and heard himself accosted in the most cordial terms by\nthe person whom he recollected as his deliverer, all the severity\nvanished from his countenance; he took Renaldo’s hand, and pressed it\nto his lips; and, while the tears gushed from his eyes, “Praised be\nGod,” said he, “that virtue and generosity are still to be found among\nthe sons of men.”Everybody in the apartment was affected by this exclamation; and\nMelvil, above all the rest, felt such emotions as he could scarcely\nrestrain. He entreated the gentleman to believe himself in the midst of\nsuch friends as would effectually secure him from all violence and\nmortification; he conjured him to compose the perturbation of his\nspirits, and quiet the apprehensions of his mind with that reflection;\nand protested, that he himself would not quit the house while his\nattendance should be deemed necessary for the stranger’s cure, or his\nconversation conducive to his amusement."

  "content": "These assurances, considered with the heroic part which the young\nHungarian had already acted in his behalf, inspired the cavalier with\nsuch a sublime idea of Melvil, that he gazed upon him with silent\nastonishment, as an angel sent from heaven for his succour; and, in the\ntransport of his gratitude, could not help exclaiming, “Sure Providence\nhath still something in reserve for this unfortunate wretch, in whose\nfavour such a miracle of courage and generosity hath interposed!”Being accommodated with proper care and attendance, his constitution in\na little time overcame the fever; and, at the third dressing, the\nsurgeon declared him out of all danger from his wounds. Then was\nRenaldo indulged with opportunities of conversing with the patient, and\nof inquiring into the particulars of his fortune and designs in life,\nwith a view to manifest the inclination he felt to serve him in his\nfuture occasions.The more this stranger contemplated the character of the Count, the\nmore his amazement increased, on account of his extraordinary\nbenevolence in favour of a person whose merit he could not possibly\nknow; he even expressed his surprise on this subject to Renaldo, who at\nlength told him, that, although his best offices should always be ready\nfor the occasions of any gentleman in distress, his particular\nattachment and regard to him was improved by an additional\nconsideration. “I am no stranger,” said he, “to the virtues and honour\nof the gallant Don Diego de Zelos.”“Heaven and earth!” cried the stranger, starting from his seat with\nextreme emotion, “do I then live to hear myself addressed by that\nlong-lost appellation! my heart glows at the expression! my spirits are\nkindled with a flame that thrills through every nerve! Say, young\ngentleman, if you are really an inhabitant of earth, by what means are\nyou acquainted with the unhappy name of Zelos?”In answer to this eager interrogation, Renaldo gave him to understand,\nthat in the course of his travels, he had resided a short time at\nSeville, where he had frequently seen Don Diego, and often heard his\ncharacter mentioned with uncommon esteem and veneration. “Alas!”\nreplied the Castilian, “that justice is no longer done to the wretched\nZelos; his honours are blasted, and his reputation canker-bitten by the\nvenomous tooth of slander.”"

  "content": "He then proceeded to unfold his misfortunes, as they have already been\nexplained in the former part of these memoirs; at the recapitulation of\nwhich, the heart of Melvil, being intendered by his own calamities, was\nso deeply affected, that he re-echoed the groans of Don Diego, and wept\nover his sufferings with the most filial sympathy. When he repeated the\nstory of that cruel fraud which was practised upon him by the faithless\nFadini, Melvil, whose mind and imagination teemed with the villanies of\nFathom, was immediately struck with the conjecture of his being the\nknave; because, indeed, he could not believe that any other person was\nso abandoned by principle and humanity as to take such a barbarous\nadvantage of a gentleman in distress.CHAPTER SIXTY-TWOHIS RETURN TO ENGLAND, AND MIDNIGHT PILGRIMAGE TO MONIMIA’S TOMB.He considered the date of that unparalleled transaction, which agreed\nwith his conjecture, and from the inquiries he made concerning the\nperson of the traitor, gathered reasons sufficient to confirm his\nsupposition. Thus certified, “That is the villain,” cried the Count,\n“whose infernal arts have overwhelmed me with such misery as Heaven\nitself hath made no remedy to dispel! To revenge my wrongs on that\nperfidious miscreant, is one of the chief reasons for which I deign to\ndrag about an hateful being. O Don Diego! what is life, when all its\nenjoyments are so easily poisoned by the machinations of such a worm!”\nSo saying, he smote his breast in all the agony of woe, and besought\nthe Spaniard to relate the steps he took in consequence of this\ndisaster.The Castilian’s cheeks reddened at this information, which enforced his\nown resentment, and casting up his eyes to heaven, “Sacred powers!”\ncried he, “let him not perish, before you bring him within my reach.\nYou ask me, noble cavalier, what measures I took in this abyss of\nmisery? For the first day, I was tortured with apprehensions for the\nfriendly Fadini, fearing that he had been robbed and murdered for the\njewels which he had, perhaps, too unwarily exposed to sale. But this\nterror soon vanished before the true presages of my fate, when, on the\nmorrow, I found the whole family in tears and confusion, and heard my\nlandlord pour forth the most bitter imprecations against the fugitive,\nwho had deflowered his daughter, and even robbed the house. You will\nask, which of the passions of my heart were interested on this\noccasion? they were shame and indignation. All my grief flowed in\nanother channel; I blushed to find my judgment deceived; I scorned to\ncomplain; but, in my heart, denounced vengeance against my base\nbetrayer. I silently retired to my apartment, in order to commune with\nmy own thoughts."

  "content": "“I had borne greater calamities without being driven to despair; I\nsummoned all my fortitude to my assistance, and resolved to live in\nspite of affliction. Thus determined, I betook myself to the house of a\ngeneral officer, whose character was fair in the world; and having\nobtained admission in consequence of my Oriental appearance, ‘To a man\nof honour,’ said I, ‘the unfortunate need no introduction. My habit\nproclaims me a Persian; this passport from the States of Holland will\nconfirm that supposition. I have been robbed of jewels to a\nconsiderable value, by a wretch whom I favoured with my confidence; and\nnow, reduced to extreme indigence, I come to offer myself as a soldier\nin the armies of France. I have health and strength sufficient to\ndischarge that duty. Nor am I unacquainted with a military life, which\nwas once my glory and occupation. I therefore sue for your protection,\nthat I may be received, though in the lowest order of them that serve\nthe King; and that your future favour may depend upon my behaviour in\nthat capacity.’“The general, surprised at my declaration, surveyed me with uncommon\nattention; he perused my certificate; asked divers questions concerning\nthe art of war, to which I returned such answers as convinced him that\nI was not wholly ignorant in that particular. In short, I was enlisted\nas a volunteer in his own regiment, and soon after promoted to the rank\nof a subaltern, and the office of equerry to his own son, who, at that\ntime, had attained to the degree of colonel, though his age did not\nexceed eighteen years.“This young man was naturally of a ferocious disposition, which had\nbeen rendered quite untractable by the pride of birth and fortune,\ntogether with the licence of his education. As he did not know the\nrespect due to a gentleman, so he could not possibly pay it to those\nwho were, unfortunately, under his command. Divers mortifications I\nsustained with that fortitude which became a Castilian who lay under\nobligations to the father; till, at length, laying aside all decorum,\nhe smote me. Sacred Heaven! he smote Don Diego de Zelos, in presence of\nhis whole household.“Had my sword been endowed with sensation, it would of itself have\nstarted from its scabbard at this indignity offered to its master. I\nunsheathed it without deliberation, saying, ‘Know, insolent boy, he is\na gentleman whom thou hast outraged; and thou hast thus cancelled the\nties which have hitherto restrained my indignation.’ His servants would\nhave interposed, but he commanded them to retire; and, flushed with\nthat confidence which the impetuosity of his temper inspired, he drew,\nin his turn, and attacked me with redoubled rage; but his dexterity\nbeing very unequal to his courage, he was soon disarmed, and\noverthrown; when, pointing my sword to his breast, ‘In consideration of\nthy youth and ignorance,’ said I, ‘I spare that life which thou hast\nforfeited by thy ungenerous presumption.’"

  "content": "“With these words, I put up my weapon, retired through the midst of his\ndomestics, who, seeing their master safe, did not think proper to\noppose my passage, and, mounting my horse, in less than two hours\nentered the Austrian dominions, resolving to proceed as far as Holland,\nthat I might embark in the first ship for Spain, in order to wash away,\nwith my own blood, or that of my enemies, the cruel stain which hath so\nlong defiled my reputation.“This was the grievance that still corroded my heart, and rendered\nineffectual the inhuman sacrifice I had made to my injured honour. This\nwas the consideration that incessantly prompted, and still importunes\nme to run every risk of life and fortune, rather than leave my fame\nunder such an ignominious aspersion. I purpose to obey this internal\ncall. I am apt to believe it is the voice of Heaven—of that Providence\nwhich manifested its care by sending such a generous auxiliary to my\naid, when I was overpowered by banditti, on the very first day of my\nexpedition.”Having in this manner gratified the curiosity of his deliverer, he\nexpressed a desire of knowing the quality of him to whom he was so\nsignally obliged; and Renaldo did not scruple to make the Castilian\nacquainted with his name and family. He likewise communicated the story\nof his unfortunate love, with all the symptoms of unutterable woe,\nwhich drew tears from the noble-hearted Spaniard, while, with a groan,\nthat announced the load which overwhelmed his soul, “I had a daughter,”\nsaid he, “such as you describe the peerless Monimia; had Heaven decreed\nher for the arms of such a lover, I, who am now the most wretched,\nshould have been the most happy parent upon earth.”"

  "content": "Thus did these new friends alternately indulge their mutual sorrow, and\nconcert measures for their future operations. Melvil earnestly\nsolicited the Castilian to favour him with his company to England,\nwhere, in all probability, both would enjoy the gloomy satisfaction of\nbeing revenged upon their common betrayer, Fathom; and, as a farther\ninducement, he assured him, that, as soon as he should have\naccomplished the melancholy purposes of his voyage, he would accompany\nDon Diego to Spain, and employ his whole interest and fortune in his\nservice. The Spaniard, thunderstruck at the extravagant generosity of\nthis proposal, could scarce believe the evidence of his own senses;\nand, after some pause, replied, “My duty would teach me to obey any\ncommand you should think proper to impose; but here my inclination and\ninterest are so agreeably flattered, that I should be equally\nungrateful and unwise, in pretending to comply with reluctance.”This point being settled, they moved forwards to Mons, as soon as Don\nDiego was in a condition to bear the shock of such a removal, and there\nremaining until his wounds were perfectly cured, they hired a\npost-chaise for Ostend, embarked in a vessel at that port, reached the\nopposite shore of England, after a short and easy passage, and arrived\nin London without having met with any sinister accident on the road.As they approached this capital, Renaldo’s grief seemed to regurgitate\nwith redoubled violence. His memory was waked to the most minute and\npainful exertion of its faculties; his imagination teemed with the most\nafflicting images, and his impatience became so ardent, that never\nlover panted more eagerly for the consummation of his wishes, than\nMelvil, for an opportunity of stretching himself upon the grave of the\nlost Monimia. The Castilian was astonished, as well as affected, at the\npoignancy of his grief, which, as a proof of his susceptibility and\nvirtue, endeared him still more to his affection; and though his own\nmisfortunes had rendered him very unfit for the office of a comforter,\nhe endeavoured, by soothing discourse, to moderate the excess of his\nfriend’s affliction.Though it was dark when they alighted at the inn, Melvil ordered a\ncoach to be called; and, being attended by the Spaniard, who would not\nbe persuaded to quit him upon such an occasion, he repaired to the\nhouse of the generous Jew, whose rheum distilled very plentifully at\nhis approach. The Count had already acquitted himself in point of\npecuniary obligations to this benevolent Hebrew; and now, after having\nmade such acknowledgments as might be expected from a youth of his\ndisposition, he begged to know by what channel he had received that\nletter which he had been so kind as to forward to Vienna."

By that letter, which you committed to the\ncharge of my worthy friend Joshua, the fatal veil was removed from my\neyes, which had been so long darkened by the artifices of incredible\ndeceit, and my own incurable misery fully presented to my view. If you\nwere acquainted with the unhappy fair, who hath fallen a victim to my\nmistake, you will have some idea of the insufferable pangs which I now\nfeel in recollecting her fate. If you have compassion for these pangs,\nyou will not refuse to conduct me to the spot where the dear remains of\nMonimia are deposited; there let me enjoy a full banquet of woe; there\nlet me feast that worm of sorrow that preys upon my heart. For such\nentertainment have I revisited this (to me) ill-omened isle; for this\nsatisfaction I intrude upon your condescension at these unseasonable\nhours; for to such a degree of impatience is my affliction whetted,\nthat no slumber shall assail mine eyelids, no peace reside within my\nbosom, until I shall have adored that earthly shrine where my Monimia\nlies! Yet would I know the circumstances of her fate. Did Heaven ordain\nno angel to minister to her distress? were her last moments\ncomfortless? ha! was not she abandoned to indigence, to insults; left\nin the power of that inhuman villain who betrayed us both? Sacred\nHeaven! why did Providence wink at the triumph of such consummate\nperfidy?”"

I am a judge of your feelings, because I know the value of\nyour loss. I attended the incomparable Monimia in her last illness, and\nam well enough acquainted with her story to conclude that she fell a\nsacrifice to an unhappy misunderstanding, effected and fomented by that\ntraitor who abused your mutual confidence.”He then proceeded to inform him of all the particulars which we have\nalready recorded, touching the destiny of the beauteous orphan, and\nconcluded with telling him he was ready to yield him any other\nsatisfaction which it was in his power to grant. The circumstances of\nthe tale had put Renaldo’s spirits into such commotion, that he could\nutter nothing but interjections and unconnected words. When Fathom’s\nbehaviour was described, he trembled with fierce agitation, started\nfrom his chair, pronouncing, “Monster! fiend! but we shall one day\nmeet.”When he was made acquainted with the benevolence of the French lady, he\nexclaimed, “O heaven-born charity and compassion! sure that must be\nsome spirit of grace sent hither to mitigate the tortures of life!\nwhere shall I find her, to offer up my thanks and adoration?” Having\nheard the conclusion of the detail, he embraced the relater, as the\nkind benefactor of Monimia, shed a flood of tears in his bosom, and\npressed him to crown the obligation, by conducting him to the solitary\nplace where now she rested from all her cares.The gentleman perceiving the transports of his grief were such as could\nnot be opposed, complied with his request, attended him in the vehicle,\nand directed the coachman to drive to a sequestered field, at some\ndistance from the city, where stood the church, within whose awful\naisle this scene was to be acted. The sexton being summoned from his\nbed, produced the keys, in consequence of a gratification, after the\nphysician had communed with him apart, and explained the intention of\nRenaldo’s visit."

The uncommon darkness of the night, the solemn\nsilence, and lonely situation of the place, conspired with the occasion\nof his coming, and the dismal images of his fancy, to produce a real\nrapture of gloomy expectation, which the whole world would not have\npersuaded him to disappoint. The clock struck twelve, the owl screeched\nfrom the ruined battlement, the door was opened by the sexton, who, by\nthe light of a glimmering taper, conducted the despairing lover to a\ndreary aisle, and stamped upon the ground with his foot, saying, “Here\nthe young lady lies interred.”Melvil no sooner received this intimation, than falling on his knees,\nand pressing his lips to the hallowed earth, “Peace,” cried he, “to the\ngentle tenant of this silent habitation.” Then turning to the\nbystanders, with a bloodshot eye, said, “Leave me to the full enjoyment\nof this occasion; my grief is too delicate to admit the company even of\nmy friends. The rites to be performed require privacy; adieu, then,\nhere must I pass the night alone.”The doctor, alarmed at this declaration, which he was afraid imported\nsome resolution fatal to his own life, began to repent of having been\naccessory to the visit, attempted to dissuade him from his purpose, and\nfinding him obstinately determined, called in the assistance of the\nsexton and coachman, and solicited the aid of Don Diego, to force\nRenaldo from the execution of his design.The Castilian knowing his friend was then very unfit for common\naltercation, interposed in the dispute, saying, “You need not be afraid\nthat he will obey the dictates of despair; his religion, his honour\nwill baffle such temptations; he hath promised to reserve his life for\nthe occasions of his friend; and he shall not be disappointed in his\npresent aim.” In order to corroborate this peremptory address, which\nwas delivered in the French language, he unsheathed his sword, and the\nothers retreating at sight of his weapon, “Count,” said he, “enjoy your\ngrief in full transport; I will screen you from interruption, though at\nthe hazard of my life; and while you give a loose to sorrow, within the\nghastly vault, I will watch till morning in the porch, and meditate\nupon the ruin of my own family and peace.”He accordingly prevailed upon the physician to retire, after he had\nsatisfied the sexton, and ordered the coachman to return by break of\nday."

Is this the fruit of those\nendearing hopes, that intercourse divine, that raptured admiration, in\nwhich so many hours insensibly elapsed? where now are those attractions\nto which I yielded up my captive heart? quenched are those genial eyes\nthat gladdened each beholder, and shone the planets of my happiness and\npeace! cold! cold and withered are those lips that swelled with love,\nand far outblushed the damask rose! and ah! forever silenced is that\ntongue, whose eloquence had power to lull the pangs of misery and care!\nno more shall my attention be ravished with the music of that voice,\nwhich used to thrill in soft vibrations to my soul!

Renaldo will be satisfied; Renaldo’s heart\nwill be at rest; his grief no more will overflow its banks, but glide\nwith equal current to his latest hour! Alas! these are the raving of my\ndelirious sorrow! Monimia hears not my complaints; her soul, sublimed\nfar, far above all sublunary cares, enjoys that felicity of which she\nwas debarred on earth.

The intelligence he obtained on\nthis occasion added indignation to his grief. The whole mystery of\nMonimia’s behaviour, which he could not before explain, now stood\ndisclosed before him. He saw the gradual progress of that infernal plan\nwhich had been laid for their mutual ruin; and his soul was inflamed\nwith such desire of vengeance, that he would have taken his leave\nabruptly, in order to set on foot an immediate inquiry about the\nperfidious author of his wrongs, that he might exterminate such a\nmonster of iniquity from the face of the earth. But he was restrained\nby Madam Clement, who gave him to understand, that Fathom was already\novertaken by the vengeance of Heaven; for she had traced him in all the\ncourse of his fortune, from his first appearance in the medical sphere\nto his total eclipse. She represented the villain as a wretch\naltogether unworthy of his attention. She said, he was so covered with\ninfamy, that no person could enter the lists against him, without\nbearing away some stain of dishonour; that he was, at present,\npeculiarly protected by the law, and sheltered from the resentment of\nRenaldo, in the cavern of his disgrace.Melvil, glowing with rage, replied, that he was a venomous serpent,\nwhich it was incumbent on every foot to crush; that it was the duty of\nevery man to contribute his whole power in freeing society from such a\npernicious hypocrite; and that, if such instances of perfidy and\ningratitude were suffered to pass with impunity, virtue and\nplain-dealing would soon be expelled from the habitations of men. “Over\nand above these motives,” said he, “I own myself so vitiated with the\nalloy of human passion and infirmity, that I desire—I eagerly pant for\nan occasion of meeting him hand to hand, where I may upbraid him with\nhis treachery, and shower down vengeance and destruction on his\nperfidious head.”Then he recounted the anecdotes of our adventurer which he had learned\nin Germany and Flanders, and concluded with declaring his unalterable\nresolution of releasing him from jail, that he might have an\nopportunity of sacrificing him, with his own hand, to the manes of\nMonimia. The discreet lady, perceiving the perturbation of his mind,\nwould not further combat the impetuosity of his passion; contenting\nherself with exacting a promise, that he would not execute his purpose,\nuntil he should have deliberated three days upon the consequences by\nwhich a step of that kind might be attended. Before the expiration of\nthat term, she thought measures might be taken to prevent the young\ngentleman from exposing his life or reputation to unnecessary hazard."

This gentleman attended\nhim to the house of the benevolent Joshua, where they dined, and where\nDon Diego was recommended, in the most fervid terms of friendship, to\nthe good offices of their host. Not that this duty was performed in\npresence of the stranger—Renaldo’s delicacy would not expose his friend\nto such a situation. While the physician, before dinner, entertained\nthat stranger in one apartment, Melvil withdrew into another, with the\nJew, to whom he disclosed the affair of the Castilian, with certain\ncircumstances, which shall, in due time, be revealed.Joshua’s curiosity being whetted by this information, he could not help\neyeing the Spaniard at table with such a particular stare, that Don\nDiego perceived his attention, and took umbrage at the freedom of his\nregard. Being unable to conceal his displeasure, he addressed himself\nto the Hebrew, with great solemnity, in the Spanish tongue, saving,\n“Signior, is there any singularity in my appearance? or, do you\nrecollect the features of Don Diego de Zelos?”“Signior Don Diego,” replied the other in pure Castilian, “I crave your\npardon for the rudeness of my curiosity, which prompted me to survey a\nnobleman, whose character I revere, and to whose misfortunes I am no\nstranger. Indeed, were curiosity alone concerned, I should be without\nexcuse; but as I am heartily inclined to serve you, as far as my weak\nabilities extend, I hope your generosity will not impute any little\ninvoluntary trespass of punctilio to my want of cordiality or esteem.”The Spaniard was not only appeased by this apology, but also affected\nwith the compliment, and the language in which it was conveyed. He\nthanked the Jew for his kind declaration, entreated him to bear, with\nthe peevishness of a disposition sore with the galling hand of\naffliction; and, turning up his eyes to Heaven, “Were it possible,”\ncried he, “for fate to reconcile contradictions, and recall the\nirremediable current of events, I would now believe that there was\nhappiness still in reserve for the forlorn Zelos, now that I tread the\nland of freedom and humanity, now that I find myself befriended by the\nmost generous of men. Alas! I ask not happiness! If, by the kind\nendeavours of the gallant Count de Melvil, to whom I am already\nindebted for my life, and by the efforts of his friends, the honour of\nmy name shall be purified and cleared from the poisonous stains of\nmalice by which it is at present spotted, I shall then enjoy all that\nsatisfaction which destiny can bestow upon a wretch whose woes are\nincurable.”"

It was, indeed, a sort of pleasure, the\nprospect of which enabled him to bear the toil of living through the\nday, though his patience was almost quite exhausted before the hour of\nassignation arrived.When the doctor appeared with the coach, he leaped into it with great\neagerness, after he had, with much difficulty, prevailed with Don Diego\nto stay at home, on account of his health, which was not yet perfectly\nestablished. The Castilian, however, would not comply with his request,\nuntil he had obtained the Count’s promise, that he should be permitted\nto accompany him next night, and take that duty alternately with the\nphysician.About midnight, they reached the place, where they found the sexton in\nwaiting, according to the orders he had received. The door was opened,\nthe mourner conducted to the tomb, and left, as before, to the gloom of\nhis own meditations. Again he laid himself on the cold ground; again he\nrenewed his lamentable strain; his imagination began to be heated into\nan ecstasy of enthusiasm, during which he again fervently invoked the\nspirit of his deceased Monimia.In the midst of these invocations, his ear was suddenly invaded with\nthe sound of some few solemn notes issuing from the organ, which seemed\nto feel the impulse of an invisible hand.At this awful salutation, Melvil was roused to the keenest sense of\nsurprise and attention. Reason shrunk before the thronging ideas of his\nfancy, which represented this music as the prelude to something strange\nand supernatural; and, while he waited for the sequel, the place was\nsuddenly illuminated, and each surrounding object brought under the\ncognisance of his eye."

He had mechanically raised himself upon one knee, with his\nbody advancing forwards; and in this attitude he gazed with a look\nthrough which his soul seemed eager to escape. To his view, thus\nstrained upon vacant space, in a few minutes appeared the figure of a\nwoman arrayed in white, with a veil that covered her face, and flowed\ndown upon her back and shoulders. The phantom approached him with an\neasy step, and, lifting up her veil, discovered (believe it, O reader!)\nthe individual countenance of Monimia.At sight of these well-known features, seemingly improved with new\ncelestial graces, the youth became a statue, expressing amazement,\nlove, and awful adoration. He saw the apparition smile with meek\nbenevolence, divine compassion, warm and intendered by that fond pure\nflame which death could not extinguish. He heard the voice of his\nMonimia call Renaldo! Thrice he essayed to answer; as oft his tongue\ndenied its office. His hair stood upright, and a cold vapour seemed to\nthrill through every nerve. This was not fear, but the infirmity of\nhuman nature, oppressed by the presence of a superior being."

He recollected all his resolution,\nand, in a strain of awestruck rapture, thus addressed the heavenly\nvisitant: “Hast thou then heard, pure spirit! the wailings of my grief?\nhast thou descended from the realms of bliss, in pity to my woe? and\nart thou come to speak the words of peace to my desponding soul? To bid\nthe wretched smile, to lift the load of misery and care from the\nafflicted breast; to fill thy lover’s heart with joy and pleasing hope,\nwas still the darling task of my Monimia, ere yet refined to that\nperfection which mortality can never attain. No wonder then, blessed\nshade, that now, when reunited to thy native heaven, thou art still\nkind, propitious, and beneficent to us, who groan in this inhospitable\nvale of sorrow thou hast left. Tell me, ah! tell me, dost thou still\nremember those fond hours we passed together? Doth that enlightened\nbosom feel a pang of soft regret, when thou recallest our fatal\nseparation? Sure that meekened glance bespeaks thy sympathy! Ah! how\nthat tender look o’erpowers me! Sacred Heaven! the pearly drops of pity\ntrickle down thy cheeks! Such are the tears that angels shed o’er man’s\ndistress!—Turn not away—Thou beckonest me to follow. Yes, I will follow\nthee, ethereal spirit, as far as these weak limbs, encumbered with\nmortality, will bear my weight; and, would to Heaven! I could, with\nease, put off these vile corporeal shackles, and attend thy flight.”So saying, he started from the ground, and, in a transport of eager\nexpectation, at awful distance, traced the footsteps of the apparition,\nwhich, entering a detached apartment, sunk down upon a chair, and with\na sigh exclaimed, “Indeed, this is too much!” What was the disorder of\nRenaldo’s mind, when he perceived this phenomenon! Before reflection\ncould perform its office, moved by a sudden impulse, he sprung\nforwards, crying, “If it be death to touch thee, let me die!” and\ncaught in his arms, not the shadow, but the warm substance of the\nall-accomplished Monimia. “Mysterious powers of Providence! this is no\nphantom! this is no shade! this is the life! the panting bosom of her\nwhom I have so long, so bitterly deplored! I fold her in my arms! I\npress her glowing breast to mine! I see her blush with virtuous\npleasure and ingenuous love! She smiles upon me with enchanting\ntenderness! O let me gaze on that transcendent beauty, which, the more\nI view it, ravishes the more! These charms are too intense; I sicken\nwhile I gaze! Merciful Heaven! is not this a mere illusion of the\nbrain? Was she not fled for ever? Had not the cold hand of death\ndivorced her from my hope? This must be some flattering vision of my\ndistempered fancy! perhaps some soothing dream— If such it be, grant, O\nye heavenly powers! that I may never wake.”“O gentle youth!” replied the beauteous orphan, still clasped in his\nembrace, “what joy now fills the bosom of Monimia, at this triumph of\nthy virtue and thy love? When I see these transports of thy affection,\nwhen I find thee restored to that place in my esteem and admiration,\nwhich thou hadst lost by the arts of calumny and malice—this is a\nmeeting which my most sanguine hopes durst not presage!”"

He was\ntherefore amazed at the interposition of Madam Clement, who, while the\nshower of sympathetic pleasure bedewed her cheeks, congratulated the\nlovers upon this happy event, crying, “These are the joys which virtue\ncalls her own.” They also received the compliments of a reverend\nclergyman, who told Monimia, she had reaped, at last, the fruits of\nthat pious resignation to the will of Heaven, which she had so devoutly\npractised during the term of her affliction. And, lastly, they were\naccosted by the physician, who was not quite so hackneyed in the ways\nof death, or so callous to the finer sensations of the soul, but that\nhe blubbered plentifully, wile he petitioned Heaven in behalf of such\nan accomplished and deserving pair.Monimia taking Madam Clement by the hand, “Whatever joy,” said she,\n“Renaldo derives from this occasion, is owing to the bounty, the\ncompassion, and maternal care of this incomparable lady, together with\nthe kind admonitions and humanity of those two worthy gentlemen.”Melvil, whose passions were still in agitation, and whose mind could\nnot yet digest the incidents that occurred, embraced them all by turns;\nbut, like the faithful needle, which, though shaken for an instant from\nits poise, immediately regains its true direction, and points\ninvariably to the pole, he soon returned to his Monimia; again he held\nher in his arms, again he drank enchantment from her eyes, and thus\npoured forth the effusions of his soul:—“Can I then trust the evidence\nof sense? And art thou really to my wish restored? Never, O never did\nthy beauty shine with such bewitching grace, as that which now\nconfounds and captivates my view! Sure there is something more than\nmortal in thy looks!—Where hast thou lived?—where borrowed this\nperfection?—whence art thou now descended?—Oh! I am all amazement, joy,\nand fear!—Thou wilt not leave me!—No! we must not part again. By this\nwarm kiss! a thousand times more sweet than all the fragrance of the\nEast! we nevermore will part. O! this is rapture, ecstasy, and what no\nlanguage can explain!”In the midst of these ejaculations, he ravished a banquet from her\nglowing lips, that kindled in his heart a flame which rushed through\nevery vein, and glided to his marrow. This was a privilege he had never\nclaimed before, and now permitted as a recompense for all the penance\nhe had suffered. Nevertheless, the cheeks of Monimia, who was\naltogether unaccustomed to such familiarities, underwent a total\nsuffusion; and Madam Clement discreetly relieved her from the anxiety\nof her situation, by interfering in the discourse, and rallying the\nCount upon his endeavours to monopolise such a branch of happiness."

O my Monimia! how will\nthe pleasure of this hour be propagated! As yet thou knowest not all\nthe bliss that is reserved for thy enjoyment!—Meanwhile, I long to\nlearn by what contrivance this happy interview hath been effected.\nStill am I ignorant how I was transported into this apartment, from the\nlonely vault in which I mourned over my supposed misfortune!”CHAPTER SIXTY-FOURTHE MYSTERY UNFOLDED—ANOTHER RECOGNITION, WHICH, IT IS TO BE HOPED, THE\nREADER COULD NOT FORESEE.The French lady then explained the whole mystery of Monimia’s death, as\na stratagem she had concerted with the clergyman and doctor, in order\nto defeat the pernicious designs of Fathom, who seemed determined to\nsupport his false pretensions by dint of perjury and fraud, which they\nwould have found it very difficult to elude. She observed, that the\nphysician had actually despaired of Monimia’s life, and it was not till\nafter she herself was made acquainted with the prognostic, that she\nwrote the letter to Renaldo, which she committed to the care of Madam\nClement, with an earnest entreaty, that it should not be sent till\nafter her decease. But that lady, believing the Count had been\ncertainly abused by his treacherous confidant, despatched the billet\nwithout the knowledge of Monimia, whose health was restored by the\nindefatigable care of the physician, and the sage exhortations of the\nclergyman, by which she was reconciled to life. In a word, the villany\nof Fathom had inspired her with some faint hope that Renaldo might\nstill be innocent; and that notion contributed not a little to her\ncure.The letter having so effectually answered their warmest hopes, in\nbringing back Renaldo such a pattern of constancy and love, the\nconfederates, in consequence of his enthusiastic sorrow, had planned\nthis meeting, as the most interesting way of restoring two virtuous\nlovers to the arms of each other; for which purpose the good clergyman\nhad pitched upon his own church, and indulged them with the use of the\nvestry, in which they now were presented with a small but elegant\ncollation."

He\npoured forth the dictates of his gratitude to the preservers of his\nhappiness.—“This church,” said he, “shall henceforth possess a double\nshare of my veneration; this holy man will, I hope, finish the\ncharitable work he has begun, by tying those bands of our happiness,\nwhich nought but death shall have power to unbind.” Then turning to\nthat object which was the star of his regard, “Do I not overrate,” said\nhe, “my interest with the fair Monimia?” She made no verbal reply; but\nanswered by an emphatic glance, more eloquent than all the power of\nrhetoric and speech. This language, which is universal in the world of\nlove, he perfectly well understood, and, in token of that faculty,\nsealed the assent which she had smiled, with a kiss imprinted on her\npolished forehead.In order to dissipate these interesting ideas, which, by being too long\nindulged, might have endangered his reason, Madam Clement entreated him\nto entertain the company with a detail of what had happened to him in\nhis last journey to the empire, and Monimia expressed a desire of\nknowing, in particular, the issue of his contest with Count Trebasi,\nwho, she knew, had usurped the succession of his father.Thus solicited, he could not refuse to gratify their curiosity and\nconcern. He explained his obligations to the benevolent Jew; related\nthe steps he had taken at Vienna for the recovery of his inheritance;\ninformed them of his happy rencontre with his father-in-law; of his\nsister’s deliverance, and marriage; of the danger into which his life\nhad been precipitated by the news of Monimia’s death; and, lastly, of\nhis adventure with the banditti, in favour of a gentleman, who, he\nafterwards understood, had been robbed in the most base and barbarous\nmanner by Fathom. He likewise, to the astonishment of all present, and\nof his mistress in particular, communicated some circumstances, which\nshall appear in due season.Monimia’s tender frame being quite fatigued with the scene she had\nacted, and her mind overwhelmed with the prosperous tidings she had\nheard, after having joined the congratulations of the company, on the\ngood fortune of her Renaldo, begged leave to retire, that she might by\nrepose recruit her exhausted spirits; and the night being pretty far\nspent, she was conducted by her lover to Madam Clement’s coach, that\nstood in waiting, in which also the rest of the company made shift to\nembark, and were carried to the house of that good lady, where, after\nthey were invited to dine, and Melvil entreated to bring Don Diego and\nthe Jew along with them, they took leave of one another, and retired to\ntheir respective lodgings in a transport of joy and satisfaction."
