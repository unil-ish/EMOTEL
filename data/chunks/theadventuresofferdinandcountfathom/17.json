Is it then honourable to skulk like an assassin, and\nplunge the secret dagger in the heart of some unhappy man, who hath\nincurred my groundless jealousy or suspicion, without indulging him\nwith that opportunity which the worst criminal enjoys? Or is it\nhonourable to poison two defenceless women, a tender wife, an amiable\ndaughter, whom even a frown would almost have destroyed?—O! this is\ncowardice, brutality, hell-born fury and revenge! Heaven hath not mercy\nto forgive such execrable guilt. Who gave thee power, abandoned\nruffian! over the lives of those whom God hath stationed as thy fellows\nof probation;—over those whom he had sent to comfort and assist thee;\nto sweeten all thy cares, and smooth the rough uneven paths of life? O!\nI am doomed to never-ceasing horror and remorse! If misery can atone\nfor such enormous guilt, I have felt it in the extreme. Like an undying\nvulture it preys upon my heart;—to sorrow I am wedded; I hug that\nteeming consort to my soul;—never, ah! never shall we part; for soon as\nmy fame shall shine unclouded by the charge of treason that now hangs\nover it, I will devote myself to penitence and woe. A cold, damp\npavement shall be my bed; my raiment shall be sackcloth; the fields\nshall furnish herbage for my food; the stream shall quench my thirst;\nthe minutes shall be numbered by my groans; the night be privy to my\nstrains of sorrow, till Heaven, in pity to my sufferings, release me\nfrom the penance I endure. Perhaps the saints whom I have murdered will\nintercede for my remission.”Such was the exercise of grief, in which the hapless Castilian consumed\nthe night; he had not yet consigned himself to rest, when Renaldo\nentering his chamber, displayed such a gleam of wildness and rapture on\nhis countenance, as overwhelmed him with amazement; for, till that\nmoment, he had never seen his visage unobscured with woe. “Pardon this\nabrupt intrusion, my friend,” cried Melvil, “I could no longer withhold\nfrom your participation, the great, the unexpected turn, which hath\nthis night dispelled all my sorrows, and restored me to the fruition of\nineffable joy. Monimia lives!—the fair, the tender, the virtuous\nMonimia lives, and smiles upon my vows! This night I retrieved her from\nthe grave. I held her in these arms; I pressed her warm delicious lips\nto mine! Oh, I am giddy with intolerable pleasure!”Don Diego was confounded at this declaration, which he considered as\nthe effects of a disordered brain. He never doubted that Renaldo’s\ngrief had at length overpowered his reason, and that his words were the\neffects of mere frenzy. While he mused on this melancholy subject, the\nCount composed his features, and, in a succinct and well-connected\ndetail, explained the whole mystery of his happiness, to the\ninexpressible astonishment of the Spaniard, who shed tears of\nsatisfaction, and straining the Hungarian to his breast, “O my son,”\nsaid he, “you see what recompense Heaven hath in store for those who\npursue the paths of real virtue; those paths from which I myself have\nbeen fatally misled by a faithless vapour, which hath seduced my steps,\nand left me darkling in the abyss of wretchedness. Such as you describe\nthis happy fair, was once my Serafina, rich in every grace of mind and\nbody which nature could bestow. Had it pleased Heaven to bless her with\na lover like Renaldo! but no more, the irrevocable shaft is fled. I\nwill not taint your enjoyment with my unavailing sighs!”"

He communicated the invitation of\nMadam Clement, and insisted upon his compliance, that he might have an\nopportunity of seeing and approving the object of his passion. “I can\nrefuse nothing to the request of Count de Melvil,” replied the\nSpaniard, “and it were ungrateful in me to decline the honour you\npropose. I own myself inflamed with a desire of beholding a young lady,\nwhose perfections I have seen reflected in your sorrow; my curiosity\nis, moreover, interested on account of that humane gentlewoman, whose\nuncommon generosity sheltered such virtue in distress; but my\ndisposition is infectious, and will, I am afraid, hang like a damp upon\nthe general festivity of your friends.”Melvil would take no denial, and having obtained his consent, repaired\nto the house of Joshua, whose countenance seemed to unbend gradually\ninto a total expression of joy and surprise, as he learned the\ncircumstances of this amazing event. He faithfully promised to attend\nthe Count at the appointed hour, and, in the meantime, earnestly\nexhorted him to take some repose, in order to quiet the agitation of\nhis spirits, which must have been violently hurried on this occasion.\nThe advice was salutary, and Renaldo resolved to follow it.He returned to his lodgings, and laid himself down; but,\nnotwithstanding the fatigue he had undergone, sleep refused to visit\nhis eyelids, all his faculties being kept in motion by the ideas that\ncrowded so fast upon his imagination. Nevertheless, though his mind\ncontinued in agitation, his body was refreshed, and he arose in the\nforenoon with more serenity and vigour than he had enjoyed for many\nmonths. Every moment his heart throbbed with new rapture, when he found\nhimself on the brink of possessing all that his soul held dear and\namiable; he put on his gayest looks and apparel; insisted upon the\nCastilian’s doing the same honour to the occasion; and the alteration\nof dress produced such an advantageous change in the appearance of Don\nDiego, that when Joshua arrived at the appointed hour, he could scarce\nrecognise his features, and complimented him very politely on the\nimprovement of his looks.True it is, the Spaniard was a personage of a very prepossessing mien\nand noble deportment; and had not grief, by increasing his native\ngravity, in some measure discomposed the symmetry of his countenance,\nhe would have passed for a man of a very amiable and engaging\nphysiognomy. They set out in the Jew’s coach for the house of Madam\nClement, and were ushered into an apartment, where they found the\nclergyman and physician with that lady, to whom Don Diego and the\nHebrew were by Melvil introduced."

  "content": "Before they had seated themselves, Renaldo inquired about the health of\nMonimia, and was directed to the next room by Madam Clement, who\npermitted him to go thither, and conduct her to the company. He was not\nslow of availing himself of this permission. He disappeared in an\ninstant, and, during his short absence, Don Diego was strangely\ndisturbed The blood flushed and forsook his cheeks by turns; a cold\nvapour seemed to shiver through his nerves; and at his breast he felt\nuncommon palpitation. Madam Clement observed his discomposure, and\nkindly inquired into the cause; when he replied, “I have such an\ninterest in what concerns the Count de Melvil, and my imagination is so\nmuch prepossessed with the perfections of Monimia, that I am, as it\nwere, agonised with expectation; yet never did my curiosity before\nraise such tumults as those that now agitate my bosom.”He had scarce pronounced these words, when the door, reopening, Renaldo\nled in this mirror of elegance and beauty, at sight of whom the\nIsraelite’s countenance was distorted into a stare of admiration. But\nif such was the astonishment of Joshua, what were the emotions of the\nCastilian, when, in the beauteous orphan, he beheld the individual\nfeatures of his long-lost Serafina!His feelings are not to be described. The fond parent, whose affection\nshoots even to a sense of pain, feels not half such transport, when he\nunexpectedly retrieves a darling child from the engulfing billows or\ndevouring flame. The hope of Zelos had been totally extinguished. His\nheart had been incessantly torn with anguish and remorse, upbraiding\nhim as the murderer of Serafina. His, therefore, were the additional\ntransports of a father disburdened of the guilt of such enormous\nhomicide. His nerves were too much overpowered by this sudden\nrecognition, to manifest the sensation of his soul by external signs.\nHe started not, nor did he lift an hand in token of surprise; he moved\nnot from the spot on which he stood; but, riveting his eyes to those of\nthe lovely phantom, remained without motion, until she, approaching\nwith her lover, fell at his feet, and clasping his knees, exclaimed,\n“May I yet call you father?”"

  "content": "This powerful shock aroused his faculties; a cold sweat bedewed his\nforehead; his knees began to totter; he dropped upon the floor, and\nthrowing his arms around her, cried, “O nature! O Serafina! Merciful\nProvidence! thy ways are past finding out.” So saying, he fell upon her\nneck, and wept aloud. The tears of sympathetic joy trickled down her\nsnowy bosom, that heaved with rapture inexpressible. Renaldo’s eyes\npoured forth the briny stream. The cheeks of Madam Clement were not dry\nin this conjuncture; she kneeled by Serafina, kissed her with all the\neagerness of maternal affection, and with uplifted hands adored the\nPower that preordained this blessed event. The clergyman and doctor\nintimately shared the general transport; and as for Joshua, the drops\nof true benevolence flowed from his eyes, like the oil on Aaron’s\nbeard, while he skipped about the room in an awkward ecstasy, and in a\nvoice resembling the hoarse notes of the long-eared tribe, cried, “O\nfather Abraham! such a moving scene hath not been acted since Joseph\ndisclosed himself unto his brethren in Egypt.”Don Diego having found utterance to his passion, proceeded in this\nstrain: “O my dear child! to find thee thus again, after our last\nunhappy parting, is wonderful! miraculous! Blessed be the all-good, my\nconscience. I am not then the dire assassin, who sacrificed his wife\nand daughter to an infernal motive, falsely titled honour? though I am\nmore and more involved in a mystery, which I long to hear explained.”“That shall be my task,” cried Renaldo, “but first permit me to implore\nyour sanction to my passion for the incomparable Serafina. You already\nknow our mutual sentiments; and though I own the possession of such\ninestimable worth and beauty would be a recompense that infinitely\ntranscends the merit I can plead, yet, as it hath been my good fortune\nto inspire her with a mutual flame, I hope to reap from your indulgence\nhere, what I could not expect from my own desert; and we present\nourselves, in hope of your paternal assent and benediction.”“Were she more fair and good and gentle than she is,” answered the\nCastilian, “and to my partial observation nought e’er appeared on earth\nmore beauteous and engaging, I would approve your title to her heart,\nand recommend you to her smiles, with all a father’s influence and\npower. Yes, my daughter! my joy on this occasion is infinitely\naugmented by the knowledge of those tender ties of love that bind thee\nto this amiable youth; a youth to whose uncommon courage and generosity\nI owe my life and my subsistence, together with the inexpressible\ndelight that now revels in my bosom. Enjoy, my children, the happy\nfruits of your reciprocal attachment. May Heaven, which hath graciously\nconducted you through a labyrinth of perplexity and woe, to this\ntransporting view of blissful days, indulge you with that uninterrupted\nstream of pure felicity, which is the hope, and ought to be the boon of\nvirtue, such as yours!”"

The tumult of these emotions having a\nlittle subsided, and the Castilian being seated betwixt Renaldo and his\nbeauteous bride, he politely bespoke the indulgence of Madam Clement,\nbegging she would permit him to demand the performance of the Count’s\npromise, that he might be forthwith made acquainted with those\ncircumstances of his own fate which he was so impatient to learn.The lady having assured him, that she and all the company would take\npleasure in hearing the recapitulation, the Spaniard, addressing\nhimself to Melvil, “In the name of Heaven!” said he, “how could you\nsupplant that rival, who fell a sacrifice to my resentment, after he\nhad bewitched the heart of Serafina? for, sure, the affection he had\nkindled in her breast must have long survived his death,” “That rival,”\nreplied the Count, “who incurred your displeasure, was no other than\nRenaldo.” With these words, he applied to one eye a patch of black silk\nprovided for the purpose, and turning his face towards Don Diego, that\ngentleman started with astonishment, crying, “Good Heaven! the very\ncountenance of Orlando, whom I slew! this is still more amazing!”CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVEA RETROSPECTIVE LINK, NECESSARY FOR THE CONCATENATION OF THESE MEMOIRS."

  "content": "“Indulge me with a patient hearing,” proceeded the Hungarian, “and all\nthese riddles soon will be explained. Inflamed with the desire of\nseeing foreign countries, I disobeyed the will of an indulgent father,\nfrom whose house, withdrawing privately, I set out for Italy, in\ndisguise, by the way of Tyrol, visited Venice, Rome, Florence, and,\nembarking at Naples, in an English ship, arrived at St. Lucar, from\nwhence I repaired to Seville; there, in a few days, was my curiosity\nengaged by the fame of the fair Serafina, who was justly deemed the\nmost accomplished beauty in that part of Spain. Nay, blush not, gentle\ncreature! for by my hopes of heaven! thy charms were even injured by\nthe cold applause of that report. Nevertheless, I was warmly interested\nby the uncommon character, and eagerly longed to see this pattern of\nperfection. As Don Diego did not train her up in that restraint to\nwhich the Spanish ladies are subjected, I soon found an opportunity of\nseeing her at church; and no person here present will, I presume, doubt\nbut that I was instantly captivated by her beauty and deportment. Had I\nthought that Don Diego’s favour was unengaged, perhaps I should have\nfollowed the dictates of vanity and inexperience, and presented myself\nin my own character, among the crowd of her professed admirers. I knew\nher father had been an officer of distinguished rank and reputation,\nand did not doubt that he would have regarded a young soldier of\nunexceptionable pedigree, and, I will even add, of untainted fame. Nor\ndid I suppose my own father could have objected against such an\nadvantageous match; but, by dint of industrious inquiry, I learned,\nthat the divine Serafina was already betrothed to Don Manuel de\nMendoza, and this information overwhelmed me with despair.“After having revolved a thousand projects for retarding and preventing\nthat detested union, I resolved to avail myself of my talent for\ndrawing, and professed myself a master of that science, in hope of\nbeing employed by the father of Serafina, who, I knew, let slip no\nopportunity of improving his daughter’s education. Accordingly I had\nthe good fortune to attract his notice, was invited to his house,\nhonoured with his approbation, and furnished with unrestricted\nopportunities of conversing with the dear object of my love. The\npassion which her beauty had kindled was by the perfections of her mind\ninflamed to such a degree of transport, as could not be concealed from\nher penetration. She chanced to relish my conversation; I gradually\nacquired her friendship; pity was the next passion that she entertained\nin my favour. I then ventured to disclose myself, and the dear charmer\ndid not disapprove of my presumption. She and her mother had been\nperplexed with some religious scruples, concerning which they appealed\nto my opinion; and I was happy enough to set their minds at ease.“This sort of intercourse naturally created a mutual confidence among\nus; and, in a word, I was blessed with the daughter’s love and mother’s\napprobation. Don Diego will pardon these clandestine measures, which we\ntook, from a full persuasion that it was impossible to render him\npropitious to the views in which our hearts and hands were so deeply\ninterested. I did not then know how little he was addicted to\nsuperstition."

When the hour of appointment arrived, I repaired to the place\nat which I had proposed to enter the house, and stumbled, in the dark,\nover the body of a man still warm, and bleeding. Alarmed at this\noccurrence, I darted myself through the window, and rushing to the\napartment of the ladies, (immortal powers!) beheld the peerless\nSerafina, and her virtuous mother, stretched on a couch, and, in all\nappearance, deprived of life.“The company will easily conceive what agonies I felt at such a\nspectacle! I ran towards the spot in a transport of horror! I clasped\nmy lovely mistress in my arms, and, finding her still breathing,\nendeavoured, but in vain, to wake her from the trance Antonia was\noverwhelmed with the same lethargic power. My fancy was immediately\nstruck with the apprehension of their being poisoned. Regardless of my\nown situation, I alarmed the family, called for assistance, and\nrequested the servants to summon Don Diego to the dismal scene. I was\ninformed that their master had rode forth in manifest confusion; and\nwhile I pondered on this surprising excursion, an apothecary in the\nneighbourhood entered the chamber, and having examined the pulses of\nthe ladies, declared that their lives were in no danger, and advised\nthat they should be undressed, and conveyed to bed. While their women\nwere busied in this employment, I went into the court-yard, attended by\nsome of the servants with lights, in order to view the body of the man\nwhich I had found at my arrival. His apparel was mean, his countenance\nferocious; a long spado was buckled to his thigh, and, in his belt,\nwere stuck a brace of loaded pistols; so that we concluded he was some\nthief, who had waited for an opportunity, and seeing the casement open,\nintended to rob the house, but was prevented, and slain by Don Diego\nhimself, whose retreat, however, did not a little confound our\nconjecture. For my own part, I remained all night in the house,\ntortured with fear, vexation, and suspense."

  "content": "“My hope was altogether disappointed by this unhappy accident; and I\nshuddered at the prospect of losing Serafina for ever, either by this\nmysterious malady, or by her marriage with Mendoza, which I now\ndespaired of being able to defeat. The major-domo having waited several\nhours for his lord’s return, without seeing him appear, thought proper\nto despatch a messenger to Don Manuel, with an account of what had\nhappened; and that nobleman arriving in the morning, took possession of\nthe house. About four o’clock in the afternoon, Serafina began to stir,\nand, at five, she and her mother were perfectly awake.“They no sooner recovered the use of reflection, than they gave signs\nof equal sorrow and amazement, and earnestly called for Isabella, who\nwas privy to our design, and who, after a very minute inquiry, was\nfound in a lone and solitary chamber, where she had been confined. Such\nwas the confusion of the house, that no person ever dreamed of asking\nhow I entered, each domestic, in all probability, supposing I had been\nintroduced by his fellow; so that I tarried unquestioned, on pretence\nof concern for the distress of a family in which I had been so\ngenerously entertained, and, by Isabella, sent my respects and duty to\nher ladies. She was, therefore, not a little surprised, when, after\nevery other servant had withdrawn, she heard the lovely Serafina\nexclaim, with all the violence of grief, ‘Ah! Isabella, Orlando is no\nmore!’ But their astonishment was still greater, when she assured them\nof my being alive, and in the house. They recounted to her the\nadventure of last night, which she explained, by informing them of the\nletters which Don Diego had intercepted. And they immediately\nconcluded, that he had, in the precipitation of his wrath, killed, by\nmistake, the person who was found dead in the court-yard. This\nconjecture alarmed them on my account; they, by the medium of Isabella,\nconjured me to leave the house, lest Don Diego should return, and\naccomplish his resentment; and I was persuaded to withdraw, after I had\nsettled the channel of a correspondence with the confidant."

  "content": "“Being now obliged to alter our measures, because our former intention\nwas discovered by Don Diego, I secured a retreat for Serafina and her\nmother, at the house of the English consul in Seville, who was my\nparticular friend; and, next day, understanding from Isabella that her\nlord had not yet reappeared, and that Don Manuel was very urgent in his\naddresses, we concerted an assignation in the garden, and that same\nevening I was fortunate enough to convey my prize to the asylum I had\nprepared for their reception. Inexpressible was the rage of Mendoza,\nwhen he heard of their elopement. He raved like one deprived of\nreason—swore he would put all the servants of the family to the\nrack—and, in consequence of the intelligence he obtained by threats and\npromises, set on foot a very strict inquiry, in order to apprehend the\nfugitives and Orlando, who had by some means or other incurred his\nsuspicion.“We eluded his search by the vigilance and caution of our kind host;\nand, while we remained in concealment, were extremely astonished to\nhear that the unfortunate Don Diego was proclaimed a traitor, and a\nprice set upon his head. This information overwhelmed us all with the\nutmost affliction. Antonia lamented, without ceasing, the disgrace of\nher beloved lord, from whom she never would have withdrawn herself, but\nwith the lively hope of a reconciliation, after the first transports of\nhis ire should have subsided, and the real character of Orlando should\nhave appeared. It was not long before we had reason to believe that\nMendoza was the accuser of Don Diego—“Nay, start not, Signior; Manuel was actually that traitor! This was\nthe turn of his revenge! when he found himself disappointed in the hope\nof possessing the incomparable Serafina, he took a base advantage of\nyour absence and retreat. He posted to Madrid, impeached you to the\nsecretary of state of having maintained a criminal correspondence with\nthe enemies of Spain, included me in his accusation, as a spy for the\nhouse of Austria, and framed such a plausible tale, from the\ncircumstances of your distress, that Don Diego was outlawed, and\nMendoza gratified with a grant of his estate.“These melancholy incidents made a deep impression upon the mind of the\nvirtuous Antonia, who waiving every other consideration, would have\npersonally appeared for the vindication of her husband’s honour, had\nnot we dissuaded her from such a rash undertaking, by demonstrating her\ninability to contend with such a powerful antagonist; and representing\nthat her appearance would be infallibly attended with the ruin of\nSerafina, who would certainly fall into the hands of the villain to\nwhom she had been contracted. We exhorted her to wait patiently for\nsome happy revolution of fortune, and encouraged her with the hope of\nDon Diego’s exerting himself effectually in his own defence."

Antonia still continued to pine over the ruin of her house; as she\ncould hear no tidings of Don Diego, she concluded he was dead, and\nmourned with unabating sorrow. In vain I assured her, that, soon as my\nown affairs should be adjusted, I would exert my whole endeavours to\nfind and succour him. She could not imagine that a man of his spirit\nand disposition would live so long in obscurity. And her affliction\nderived new force from the death of the consul’s widow, with whom she\nhad lived in the most unbounded intimacy and friendship. From that day,\nher health evidently declined. She foresaw her dissolution, and\ncomforted herself with the hope of seeing her husband and her friend in\na place where no treachery is felt, and no sorrow is known; confident\nof my integrity, and the purity of my love, she, in the most pathetic\nterms, recommended Serafina to my care.“Ha! weepest thou, fair excellence, at the remembrance of that tender\nscene, when the good Antonia, on the bed of death, joined thy soft hand\nto mine, and said, ‘Renaldo, I bequeath this orphan to your love; it is\na sacred pledge, which, if you cherish with due honour and regard,\ninternal peace and happiness will ever smile within your bosom; but if\nyou treat it with indifference, dishonour, or neglect, just Heaven will\npunish your breach of trust with everlasting disappointments and\ndisquiet.’“Signior Don Diego, I see you are moved, and therefore will not dwell\non such distressful circumstances. The excellent Antonia exchanged this\nlife for a more happy state; and so exquisite was the sorrow of the\ntender-hearted Serafina, as to torture me with the apprehension that\nshe would not long survive her pious mother. How I obeyed the\ninjunctions of that departing saint, Monimia (for that name she now\nassumed) can testify, until that artful serpent Fathom glided into our\nmutual confidence, abused our ears, poisoned our unsuspected faith, and\neffected that fatal breach, productive of all the misery and vexation\nwhich we have suffered, and which is now so happily expelled.”“Heaven,” said the Castilian, “hath visited me for the sins and errors\nof my youth; yet, such mercy hath been mingled with its chastisements,\nI dare not murmur or repine. The tears of penitence and sorrow shall\nwater my Antonia’s grave; as for Mendoza, I rejoice at his treachery,\nby which the obligation of my promise is cancelled, and my honour fully\nacquitted. He shall not triumph in his guilt. My services, my\ncharacter, and innocence shall soon confront his perfidy, and, I hope,\ndefeat his interest. The King is just and gracious, nor is my family\nand name unknown.”"

At the same\ntime Don Diego was summoned to present himself before the King within a\nlimited time, to answer to the charge which Mendoza had brought against\nhim.The Spaniard’s heart overflowed with gratitude and joy, when he read\nthis intimation; he embraced the Jew, who, before Zelos could give\nutterance to his thoughts, told him that the Spanish Ambassador at\nLondon, having been prepossessed in his favour, craved the honour of\nseeing Don Diego; and that he, Joshua, was ready to conduct him to the\nhouse.“Then is my heart at rest!” cried the Castilian; “the house of Zelos\nonce more shall lift up its head.

O\nmy children! this day is replete with such joy and satisfaction, as I\ndid not think had been in the power of Heaven to grant, without the\ninterposition of a miracle!

The lovers\nfeasted their eyes more than their appetite, by a tender intercourse of\nglances, which needed not the slow interpretation of speech; while the\nSpaniard regarded them alternately with looks of wonder and paternal\njoy, and every individual surveyed the all-deserving pair with\nadmiration and esteem."

The doctor, who has traced him in all his\nconduct and vicissitudes of fortune, will draw a picture of his present\nwretchedness, which, I doubt not, will move your compassion, as it hath\nalready excited mine.”The generous hostess was ready to enforce this charitable proposal with\nall her eloquence, when Melvil, with a look that well expressed his\nmagnanimity of love, replied, “Such a boon becomes the gentle Serafina!\nO! every moment furnishes me with fresh matter to admire the virtues of\nthy soul. If thou, whose tender heart hath been so rent with misery and\nanguish, canst intercede for thy tormentor, who now suffers in his\nturn, shall I refuse to pardon the miserable wretch! No, let me glory\nin imitating the great example, and solicit Don Diego in behalf of the\nsame miscreant whose perfidious barbarity cost him such intolerable\nwoe.” “Enough,” cried the Castilian, “I have disclaimed the vindictive\nprinciples of a Spaniard; and leave the miserable object to the sting\nof his own conscience, which, soon or late, will not fail to avenge the\nwrongs we have sustained from his deceit.”CHAPTER SIXTY-SIXTHE HISTORY DRAWS NEAR A PERIOD.Universal was the applause which they acquired by this noble sacrifice\nof their resentment. The afternoon was spent in the utmost harmony and\ngood-humour; and at the earnest solicitation of Renaldo, whose fancy\nstill harboured the apprehensions of another separation, Don Diego\nconsented that the indissoluble knot should be tied between that young\ngentleman and Serafina in two days, and the place appointed for the\nceremony was the very church where they had been restored to the arms\nof each other."

Fraught with this\ninstruction, the Israelite desired a private audience of the Castilian,\nin which, after an apology for the freedom of his demand, “Signior Don\nDiego,” said he, “as your fortune hath been so long embezzled by your\nadversary in Spain, and your correspondence with that country entirely\ncut off, it is not to be supposed that your finances are at present in\nsuch a condition as to maintain the splendour of your family. Count de\nMelvil’s whole fortune is at your command; and had not he been afraid\nof giving umbrage to the peculiar delicacy of your sentiments, he would\nhave pressed you to use it for your convenience. For my own part, over\nand above the inclination I have to serve Don Diego, I consult my own\nprivate advantage in desiring you to accept my service on this\noccasion. Money is the chief commodity in which I deal, and, if you\nhonour me with your commands, I shall be a gainer by my obedience.”Don Diego replied, with a smile that denoted how well he understood the\nmeaning of this address, “Surely, Signior, I am bound by the strongest\nties to exert my utmost endeavours for your advantage; and I pray God\nthis your proposal may have that issue. I am well acquainted with the\nCount’s generosity and refined notions of honour; and too much obliged\nby him already, to hesitate with punctilious reserve in accepting his\nfuture assistance. Nevertheless, since you have contrived a scheme for\nremoving all scruples of that sort, I shall execute it with pleasure;\nand, in the form of business, you shall have all the security I can\ngive for what shall be necessary to answer my present occasions.”"

Although the Spaniard had been accustomed to the\nuncommon generosity of Melvil, he could not help wondering at this\nnobleness of behaviour, so little to be expected from any merchant,\nmuch less from a Jewish broker.While this affair was on the anvil, Renaldo, who could no longer\nwithhold the communication of his happiness from his sister and\nrelations in Germany, took up the pen, and, in a letter to his\nbrother-in-law, recounted all the circumstances of the surprising turn\nof fate which he had experienced since his arrival in England. He\nlikewise related the story of Don Diego, informed them of the day\nappointed for his nuptials, and entreated the Major to make a journey\nto London with his wife; or, if that should be impracticable, to come\nas far as Brussels, where they should be met by him and his Serafina.\nThere was now but one day between him and the accomplishment of his\ndearest wish, and that was spent in procuring a licence, and adjusting\nthe preparations for the grand festival. Don Diego in the forenoon\nvisited Madam Clement, to whom he repeated his warm acknowledgments of\nher bounty and maternal affection to his daughter, and presented to\nSerafina bank notes to the amount of five hundred pounds, to defray the\nnecessary expense for her wedding ornaments."

  "content": "All the previous steps being taken for the solemnisation of this\ninteresting event, and the hour of appointment arrived, the bridegroom,\naccompanied by his father-in-law, hastened to the place of rendezvous,\nwhich was the vestry-room of the church we have already described;\nwhere they were received by the good clergyman in his canonicals; and\nhere they had not waited many minutes, when they were joined by Madam\nClement and the amiable bride, escorted by the friendly physician, who\nhad all along borne such a share in their concerns. Serafina was\ndressed in a sack of white satin, and the ornaments of her head were\nadjusted in the Spanish fashion, which gave a peculiar air to her\nappearance, and an additional spirit to those attractions which engaged\nthe heart of each beholder. There was nothing remarkable in the habit\nof Renaldo, who had copied the plainness and elegance of his mistress;\nbut, when she entered the place, his features were animated with a\ndouble proportion of vivacity, and their eyes meeting, seemed to kindle\na blaze which diffused warmth and joy through the countenances of all\npresent.After a short pause, her father led her to the altar, and gave her away\nto the transported Renaldo, before the priest who performed the\nceremony, and bestowed the nuptial benediction on this enraptured pair.\nThe sanction of the church being thus obtained, they withdrew into the\nvestry, where Melvil sealed his title on her rosy lips, and presented\nhis wife to the company, who embraced her in their turns, with fervent\nwishes for their mutual happiness.Though the scene of this transaction was remote from any inhabited\nneighbourhood, the church was surrounded by a crowd of people, who,\nwith uncommon demonstration of surprise and admiration, petitioned\nHeaven to bless so fair a couple. Such indeed was their eagerness to\nsee them, that some lives were endangered by the pressure of the crowd,\nwhich attended them with loud acclamations to the coach, after the\nbridegroom had deposited in the hands of the minister one hundred\npounds for the benefit of the poor of that parish, and thrown several\nhandfuls of money among the multitude. Serafina re-embarked in Madam\nClement’s convenience, with that good lady and Don Diego, while\nRenaldo, with the clergyman and doctor, followed in Joshua’s coach, to\na pleasant country-house upon the Thames, at a distance of a few miles\nfrom London. This the Jew had borrowed from the owner for a few days,\nand there they were received by that honest Hebrew, who had provided a\nvery elegant entertainment for the occasion. He had also bespoke a\nsmall but excellent band of music, which regaled their ears while they\nsat at dinner; and the afternoon being calm and serene, he prevailed on\nthem to take the air on the river, in a barge which he had prepared for\nthe purpose."

  "content": "But, notwithstanding this diversity of amusement, Renaldo would have\nfound it the longest day he had ever passed, had not his imagination\nbeen diverted by an incident which employed his attention during the\nremaining part of the evening. They had drunk tea, and engaged in a\nparty at whist, when they were surprised with a noise of contention\nfrom a public-house, that fronted the windows of the apartment in which\nthey sat. Alarmed at this uproar, they forsook their cards, and,\nthrowing up the casement, beheld a hearse surrounded by four men on\nhorseback, who had stopped the carriage, and violently pulled the\ndriver from his seat. This uncommon arrest had engaged the curiosity of\nthe publican’s family, who stood at the door to observe the\nconsequence, when all of a sudden appeared a person in canonicals, well\nmounted, who, riding up to those who maltreated the driver, bestowed\nupon one of them such a blow with the butt-end of his whip, as laid him\nsprawling on the ground; and, springing from his saddle upon the box,\ntook the reins into his own hand, swearing with great vehemence, that\nhe would murder every man who should attempt to obstruct the hearse.The good priest who had married Renaldo was not a little scandalised at\nthis ferocious behaviour in a clergyman, and could not help saying\naloud, he was a disgrace to the cloth when the horseman looking up to\nthe window, replied, “Sir, may I be d—n’d, if any man in England has a\ngreater respect for the cloth than I have; but at present I am quite\ndistracted.” So saying, he whipped up the horses, and had actually\ndisentangled the hearse from those who surrounded it, when he was\nopposed by another troop, one of whom alighted with great expedition,\nand cut the harness so as that he could not possibly proceed. Finding\nhimself thus driven to bay, he leaped upon the ground, and exercised\nhis weapon with such amazing strength and agility, that several of his\nantagonists were left motionless on the field, before he was\noverpowered and disarmed by dint of numbers, who assailed him on all\nsides.The mad parson being thus taken prisoner, an elderly person, of a very\nprepossessing appearance, went up to the hearse, and, unbolting the\ndoor, a young lady sprung out, and shrieking, ran directly to the\npublic-house, to the infinite astonishment and affright of the whole\nfamily, who believed it was the spirit of the deceased person, whose\nbody lay in the carriage. Renaldo, who was with difficulty restrained\nfrom interposing in behalf of the clergyman against such odds, no\nsooner perceived this apparition, than, supposing her to be some\ndistressed damsel, his Quixotism awoke, he descended in an instant, and\nrushed into the house, among those that pursued the fair phantom. Don\nDiego and the physician took the same road, while the real clergyman\nand Joshua tarried with the ladies, who were, by this time, very much\ninterested in the event."

  "content": "Melvil found the young lady in the hands of the old gentleman, who had\nreleased her from the hearse, and who now bitterly upbraided her for\nher folly and disobedience; while she protested with great vivacity,\nthat whatever she might suffer from his severity, she would never\nsubmit to the hateful match he had proposed, nor break the promise she\nhad already made to the gentleman who now attempted to rescue her from\nthe tyranny of a cruel father. This declaration was followed by a\nplentiful shower of tears, which the father could not behold with\nunmoistened eyes, although he reviled her with marks of uncommon\ndispleasure; and turning to the Count, “I appeal to you, sir,” said he,\n“whether I have not reason to curse the undutiful obstinacy of that\npert baggage, and renounce her for ever as an alien to my blood. She\nhas, for some months, been solicited in marriage by an honest citizen,\na thirty thousand pound man; and instead of listening to such an\nadvantageous proposal, she hath bestowed her heart upon a young fellow\nnot worth a groat. Ah! you degenerate hussy, this comes of your plays\nand romances. If thy mother were not a woman of an unexceptionable life\nand conversation, I should verily believe thou art no child of mine.\nRun away with a beggar! for shame!”“I suppose,” replied Renaldo, “the person to whom your daughter’s\naffection inclines, is that clergyman who exerted himself so manfully\nat the door?” “Clergyman!” cried the other, “adad! he has more of the\ndevil than the church about him. A ruffian! he has, for aught I know,\nmurdered the worthy gentleman whom I intended for my son-in-law; and\nthe rogue, if I had not kept out of his way, would, I suppose, have\nserved me with the same sauce. Me! who have been his master for many\nyears, and had resolved to make a man of him. Sir, he was my own clerk,\nand this is the return I have met with from the serpent which I\ncherished in my bosom.”Here he was interrupted by the arrival of the citizen for whom he had\nexpressed such concern; that gentleman had received a contusion upon\none eye, by which the sight was altogether obstructed, so that he\nconcluded he should never retrieve the use of that organ, and with\ngreat clamour took all the spectators to witness the injury he had\nsustained; he entered the room with manifest perturbation, demanded\nsatisfaction of the father, and peremptorily declared it should not be\na lost eye to him if there was law in England. This unseasonable\ndemand, and the boisterous manner in which it was made, did not at all\nsuit the present humour of the old gentleman, who told him peevishly he\nowed him no eye, and bade him go and ask reparation of the person who\nhad done him wrong."

The old gentleman thanked them for their courtesy, which he did\nnot think proper to refuse, and while he led, or rather hauled\nMademoiselle over the way, under the auspices of the Castilian, Renaldo\nset the lover at liberty, made him a tender of his good offices, and\nadvised him to wait at the public-house for an happy issue of their\nnegotiation.The pseudo-parson was very much affected by this generous proffer, for\nwhich he made suitable acknowledgments, and protested before God he\nwould die a thousand deaths rather than part with his dear Charlotte.\nHer father no sooner entered the apartment, than he was known by Joshua\nto be a considerable trader in the city of London, and the merchant was\nglad to find himself among his acquaintance. He was so full of the\nstory which had brought him thither, that he had scarce sat down when\nhe began to complain of his hard fate, in having an only child who was\nso mean, stubborn, and contumacious; and every sentence was concluded\nwith an apostrophe of reproaches to the delinquent.The Jew having allowed him to ring out his alarm, condoled his\nmisfortune, and gravely counselled the young lady to wean her\naffections from such an unworthy object, for he supposed her favourite\nwas a man of no principle, or liberal endowments, otherwise her father\nwould not exclaim so bitterly against her conduct. Charlotte, who\nwanted neither beauty nor understanding, assured him that her lover’s\ncharacter was, in all respects, unblemished, for the truth of which\nassertion she appealed to her papa, who owned, with reluctance, that\nthe young man was a gentleman by birth, that he had served him with\nremarkable diligence and integrity, and that his accomplishments were\nfar superior to his station in life. “But then,” said he, “the fellow\nhas not a shilling of his own, and would you have me give away my\ndaughter to a beggar?”"
