  "content": "The more pathetically he pleaded for her compliance, the more\nstrenuously did she resist his remonstrances. She advanced all the\narguments her reason, love, and terror could suggest, reminded him of\nher oath, from which he could not suppose she would recede, whatever\nthe consequence might be; and in conclusion vowed to Heaven, with great\nsolemnity and devotion, that she would not survive the news of his\ndeath. Thus the alternative she offered was either to retain the chain\nand be happy in her affection, or forfeit all title to her love, and\ndie in the conviction of having brought his innocent mistress to an\nuntimely grave.His fortitude was not proof against this last consideration. “My savage\nhonour,” said he, “would enable me to endure the pangs of eternal\nseparation in the confidence of being endowed with the power of ending\nthese tortures by the energy of my own hand; but the prospect of\nWilhelmina’s death, and that too occasioned by my inflexibility,\ndisarms my soul of all her resolution, swallows up the dictates of my\njealous pride, and fills my bosom with such a gush of tenderness and\nsorrow, as overwhelms the whole economy of my purpose! Yes, enchanting\ncreature! I sacrifice my glory to that irresistible reflection; and,\nrather than know myself the cruel instrument of robbing the world of\nsuch perfection, consent to retain the fatal testimony of your love.”So saying, he pocketed the chain, with an air of ineffable\nmortification, and was rewarded for his compliance with the most\nendearing caresses of his Dulcinea, who, amidst the tumults of her joy,\nejaculated a thousand acknowledgments to Heaven for having blessed her\nwith the affection of such a man, whose honour was unrivalled by\nanything but his love.CHAPTER SIXTEENHIS SUCCESS BEGETS A BLIND SECURITY, BY WHICH HE IS ONCE AGAIN\nWELL-NIGH ENTRAPPED IN HIS DULCINEA’S APARTMENT.In this manner did the crafty Fathom turn to account those ingratiating\nqualifications he inherited from nature, and maintain, with incredible\nassiduity and circumspection, an amorous correspondence with two\ndomestic rivals, who watched the conduct of each other with the most\nindefatigable virulence of envious suspicion, until an accident\nhappened, which had well-nigh overturned the bark of his policy, and\ninduced him to alter the course, that he might not be shipwrecked on\nthe rocks that began to multiply in the prosecution of his present\nvoyage."

  "content": "The jeweller, who, as a German, wanted neither pride nor ostentation,\nnever failed to celebrate the anniversary of his birth by an annual\nfeast granted to his neighbours and friends; and on these occasions was\naccustomed to wear that chain which, though bequeathed to his daughter,\nhe considered as an ornament appertaining to the family, whereof he\nhimself was head. Accordingly, when the time of this festival revolved,\nhe, as usual, ordered Wilhelmina to surrender it for the day. This\ninjunction, the reader will perceive, our young lady was in no\ncondition to obey; she had, however, foreseen the demand, and contrived\na scheme of behaviour for the occasion, which she forthwith put in\nexecution.With an air of uncommon cheerfulness, purposely assumed, she retired to\nher closet, on pretence of complying with his desire, and, having\nemployed a few minutes in rummaging her drawers and disordering her\nmoveables, uttered a loud shriek, that brought her father instantly\ninto the apartment, where he found his daughter tossing about her\nclothes and trinkets with violent demonstrations of disorder and\naffright, and heard her, in a lamentable strain, declare that she was\nrobbed of her chain, and for ever undone. This was so far from being an\nagreeable intimation to the jeweller, that he was struck dumb with\nastonishment and vexation, and it was not till after a long pause that\nhe pronounced the word Sacrament! with an emphasis denoting the most\nmortifying surprise.Soon as that exclamation escaped from his lips, he flew to the\nescritoire as if instinctively, and, joining Wilhelmina in her\noccupation, tumbled its whole contents upon the floor in a trice."

Notwithstanding this apology, and the efforts he made in\nthe sequel to entertain his friends with jollity and good-humour, his\nheart was so linked to the chain, that he could not detach himself from\nthe thoughts of it, which invaded him at short intervals in such qualms\nas effectually spoiled his appetite, and hindered his digestion.He revolved within himself the circumstances of his disaster, and, in\ncanvassing all the probable means by which the chain would be stolen,\nconcluded that the deed must have been done by some person in the\nfamily, who, in consequence of having access to his daughter’s chamber,\nhad either found the drawer left open by her carelessness and neglect,\nor found means to obtain a false key, by some waxen impression; for the\nlocks of the escritoire were safe and uninjured. His suspicion being\nthus confined within his own house, sometimes pitched upon his workmen,\nand sometimes upon his wife, who, he thought, was the more likely to\npractise such finesse, as she considered Wilhelmina in the light of a\ndaughter-in-law, whose interest interfered with her own, and who had\noften harangued to him in private on the folly of leaving this very\nchain in the young lady’s possession."

Aroused by these sentiments, he resolved to retaliate her own\nschemes, by contriving means to visit her cabinet in secret, and, if\npossible, to rob the robber of the spoils she had gathered to his\nprejudice, without coming to any explanation, which might end in\ndomestic turmoils and eternal disquiet.While the husband exercised his reflection in this manner, his innocent\nmate did not allow the powers of her imagination to rest in idleness\nand sloth. Her observations touching the loss of the chain were such as\na suspicious woman, biassed by hatred and envy, would naturally make.\nTo her it seemed highly improbable, that a thing of such value, so\ncarefully deposited, should vanish without the connivance of its\nkeeper, and without much expense of conjecture, divined the true manner\nin which it was conveyed. The sole difficulty that occurred in the\nresearches of her sagacity, was to know the gallant who had been\nfavoured with such a pledge of Wilhelmina’s affection; for, as the\nreader will easily imagine, she never dreamed of viewing Ferdinand in\nthat odious perspective. In order to satisfy her curiosity, discover\nthis happy favourite, and be revenged on her petulant rival, she\nprevailed upon the jeweller to employ a scout, who should watch all\nnight upon the stair, without the knowledge of any other person in the\nfamily, alleging, that in all likelihood, the housemaid gave private\nadmittance to some lover who was the author of all the losses they had\nlately suffered, and that they might possibly detect him in his\nnocturnal adventures; and observing that it would be imprudent to\nintimate their design to Wilhelmina, lest, through the heedlessness and\nindiscretion of youth, she might chance to divulge the secret, so as to\nfrustrate their aim."

  "content": "A Swiss, in whose honesty the German could confide, being hired for\nthis purpose, was posted in a dark corner of the staircase, within a\nfew paces of the door, which he was directed to watch, and actually\nstood sentinel three nights, without perceiving the least object of\nsuspicion; but, on the fourth, the evil stars of our adventurer\nconducted him to the spot, on his voyage to the apartment of his\nDulcinea, with whom he had preconcerted the assignation. Having made\nthe signal, which consisted of two gentle taps on her door, he was\nimmediately admitted; and the Swiss no sooner saw him fairly housed,\nthan he crept softly to the other door, that was left open for the\npurpose, and gave immediate intimation of what he had perceived. This\nintelligence, however, he could not convey so secretly, but the lovers,\nwho were always vigilant upon these occasions, overheard a sort of\ncommotion in the jeweller’s chamber, the cause of which their\napprehension was ingenious enough to comprehend.We have formerly observed that our adventurer could not make his\nretreat by the door, without running a very great risk of being\ndetected, and the expedient of the chimney he had no inclination to\nrepeat; so that he found himself in a very uncomfortable dilemma, and\nwas utterly abandoned by all his invention and address, when his\nmistress, in a whisper, desired him to begin a dialogue, aloud, in an\napology, importing, that he had mistaken the door, and that his\nintention was to visit her father, touching a ring belonging to the\nyoung Count Melvil, which she knew Fathom had put into his hands, in\norder to be altered.Ferdinand, seizing the hint, availed himself of it without delay, and,\nunbolting the door, pronounced in an audible voice, “Upon my honour,\nMademoiselle, you wrong my intention, if you imagine I came hither with\nany disrespectful or dishonourable motive. I have business with your\nfather, which cannot be delayed till to-morrow, without manifest\nprejudice to my friend and myself; therefore I took the liberty of\nvisiting him at these untimely hours, and it has been my misfortune to\nmistake the door in the dark. I beg pardon for my involuntary\nintrusion, and again assure you, that nothing was farther from my\nthoughts than any design to violate that respect which I have always\nentertained for you and your father’s family.”"

  "content": "To this remonstrance, which was distinctly heard by the German and his\nwife, who by this time stood listening at the door, the young lady\nreplied, in a shrill accent of displeasure, “Sir, I am bound to believe\nthat all your actions are conducted by honour; but you must give me\nleave to tell you, that your mistake is a little extraordinary, and\nyour visit, even to my father, at this time of the night, altogether\nunseasonable, if not mysterious. As for the interruption I have\nsuffered in my repose, I impute it to my own forgetfulness, in leaving\nmy door unlocked, and blame myself so severely for the omission, that I\nshall, to-morrow, put it out of my own power to be guilty of the like\nfor the future, by ordering the passage to be nailed up; meanwhile, if\nyou would persuade me of your well-meaning, you will instantly\nwithdraw, lest my reputation should suffer by your continuance in my\napartment.”“Madam,” answered our hero, “I will not give you an opportunity to\nrepeat the command, which I shall forthwith obey, after having\nentreated you once more to forgive the disturbance I have given.” So\nsaying, he gently opened the door, and, at sight of the German and his\nwife, who, he well knew, waited for his exit, started back, and gave\ntokens of confusion, which was partly real and partly affected. The\njeweller, fully satisfied with Fathom’s declaration to his daughter,\nreceived him with a complaisant look, and, in order to alleviate his\nconcern, gave him to understand, that he already knew the reason of his\nbeing in that apartment, and desired to be informed of what had\nprocured him the honour to see him at such a juncture."

After begging pardon for having intruded upon your\nfamily at these hours, I must now tell you that my cousin, Count\nMelvil, was some time ago so much misrepresented to his mother by\ncertain malicious informers, who delight in sowing discord in private\nfamilies, that she actually believed her son an extravagant\nspendthrift, who had not only consumed his remittances in the most\nriotous scenes of disorder, but also indulged a pernicious appetite for\ngaming, to such a degree, that he had lost all his clothes and jewels\nat play. In consequence of such false information, she expostulated\nwith him in a severe letter, and desired he would transmit to her that\nring which is in your custody, it being a family stone, for which she\nexpressed an inestimable value. The young gentleman, in his answer to\nher reproof, endeavoured to vindicate himself from the aspersions which\nhad been cast upon his character, and, with regard to the ring, told\nher it was at present in the hands of a jeweller, in order to be new\nset according to her own directions, and that, whenever it should be\naltered, he would send it home to her by some safe conveyance. This\naccount the good lady took for an evasion, and upon that supposition\nhas again written to him, in such a provoking style, that, although the\nletter arrived but half an hour ago, he is determined to despatch a\ncourier before morning with the mischievous ring, for which, in\ncompliance with the impetuosity of his temper, I have taken the freedom\nto disturb you at this unseasonable hour.”The German paid implicit faith to every circumstance of his story,\nwhich indeed could not well be supposed to be invented extempore; the\nring was immediately restored, and our adventurer took his leave,\ncongratulating himself upon his signal deliverance from the snare in\nwhich he had fallen.CHAPTER SEVENTEENTHE STEP-DAME’S SUSPICIONS BEING AWAKENED, SHE LAYS A SNARE FOR OUR\nADVENTURER, FROM WHICH HE IS DELIVERED BY THE INTERPOSITION OF HIS GOOD\nGENIUS.Though the husband swallowed the bait without further inquiry, the\npenetration of the wife was not so easily deceived. That same dialogue\nin Wilhelmina’s apartment, far from allaying, rather inflamed her\nsuspicion; because, in the like emergency, she herself had once\nprofited by the same, or nearly the same contrivance. Without\ncommunicating her doubts to the father, she resolved to double her\nattention to the daughter’s future conduct, and keep such a strict eye\nover the behaviour of our gallant, that he should find it very\ndifficult, if not impossible, to elude her observation. For this\npurpose she took into her pay an old maiden, of the right sour\ndisposition, who lived in a house opposite to her own, and directed her\nto follow the young lady in all her outgoings, whenever she should\nreceive from the window a certain signal, which the mother-in-law\nagreed to make for the occasion. It was not long before this scheme\nsucceeded to her wish. The door of communication betwixt Wilhelmina’s\napartment and the staircase being nailed up by the jeweller’s express\norder, our adventurer was altogether deprived of those opportunities he\nhad hitherto enjoyed, and was not at all mortified to find himself so\nrestricted in a correspondence which began to be tiresome and\ndisagreeable. But the case was far otherwise with his Dulcinea, whose\npassion, the more it was thwarted, raged with greater violence, like a\nfire, that, from the attempts that are made to extinguish it, gathers\ngreater force, and flames with double fury."

This intimation she proposed to convey privately\ninto the hand of her lover, during his next visit to the family; but\nboth were so narrowly eyed by the mother, that she found the execution\nof her design impracticable; and next forenoon, on pretence of going to\nchurch, repaired to the house of a companion, who, being also her\nconfidant, undertook to deliver the billet with her own hand.The she-dragon employed by her mother, in obedience to the sign which\nwas displayed from the window immediately put on her veil, and followed\nWilhelmina at a distance, until she saw her fairly housed. She would\nnot even then return from her excursion, but hovered about in sight of\nthe door, with a view of making further observations. In less than five\nminutes after the young lady disappeared, the scout perceived her\ncoming out, accompanied by her comrade, from whom she instantly parted,\nand bent her way towards the church in good earnest, while the other\nsteered her course in another direction. The duenna, after a moment’s\nsuspense and consideration, divined the true cause of this short visit,\nand resolved to watch the motions of the confidant, whom she traced to\nthe academy in which our hero lodged, and from which she saw her\nreturn, after the supposed message was delivered."

Her employer was equally astonished and incensed at this\ninformation. She was seized with all that frenzy which takes possession\nof a slighted woman, when she finds herself supplanted by a detested\nrival; and, in the first transports of her indignation, devoted them as\nsacrifices to her vengeance. Nor was her surprise so much the effect of\nhis dissimulation, as of his want of taste and discernment. She\ninveighed against him, not as the most treacherous lover, but as the\nmost abject wretch, in courting the smiles of such an awkward dowdy,\nwhile he enjoyed the favours of a woman who had numbered princes in the\ntrain of her admirers. For the brilliancy of her attractions, such as\nthey at present shone, she appealed to the decision of her minister,\nwho consulted her own satisfaction and interest, by flattering the\nother’s vanity and resentment; and so unaccountable did the depravity\nof our hero’s judgment appear to this conceited dame, that she began to\nbelieve there was some mistake in the person, and to hope that\nWilhelmina’s gallant was not in reality her professed admirer, Mr.\nFathom, but rather one of his fellow-lodgers, whose passion he favoured\nwith his mediation and assistance.On this notion, which nothing but mere vanity could have inspired, in\nopposition to so many more weighty presumptions, she took the\nresolution of bringing the affair to a fuller explanation, before she\nwould concert any measures to the prejudice of our adventurer, and\nforthwith despatched her spy back to his lodgings, to solicit, on the\npart of Wilhelmina, an immediate answer to the letter he had received.\nThis was an expedition with which the old maiden would have willingly\ndispensed, because it was founded upon an uncertainty, which might be\nattended with troublesome consequences; but, rather than be the means\nof retarding a negotiation so productive of that sort of mischief which\nis particularly agreeable to all of her tribe, she undertook to manage\nand effect the discovery, in full confidence of her own talents and\nexperience."

  "content": "With such a fund of self-sufficiency and instigation, she repaired to\nthe academy on the instant, and inquiring for Mr. Fathom, was\nintroduced to his apartment, where she found him in the very act of\nwriting a billet to the jeweller’s daughter. The artful agent having\nasked, with the mysterious air of an expert go-between, if he had not\nlately received a message from a certain young lady, and, being\nanswered in the affirmative, gave him to understand, that she herself\nwas a person favoured with the friendship and confidence of Wilhelmina,\nwhom she had known from her cradle, and often dandled on her knee;\nthen, in the genuine style of a prattling dry nurse, she launched out\nin encomiums on his Dulcinea’s beauty and sweetness of temper,\nrecounting many simple occurrences of her infancy and childhood; and,\nfinally, desiring a more circumstantial answer to that which she had\nsent to him by her friend Catherina. In the course of her loquacity she\nhad also, according to her instructions, hinted at the misfortune of\nthe door; and, on the whole, performed her cue with such dexterity and\ndiscretion that our politician was actually overreached, and, having\nfinished his epistle, committed it to her care, with many verbal\nexpressions of eternal love and fidelity to his charming Wilhelmina.The messenger, doubly rejoiced at her achievement, which not only\nrecommended her ministry, but also gratified her malice, returned to\nher principal with great exultation, and, delivering the letter, the\nreader will easily conceive the transports of that lady when she read\nthe contents of it in these words:—“ANGELIC WILHELMINA!—To forget those ecstatic scenes we have enjoyed\ntogether, or even live without the continuation of that mutual bliss,\nwere to quit all title to perception, and resign every hope of future\nhappiness. No! my charmer, while my head retains the least spark of\ninvention, and my heart glows with the resolution of a man, our\ncorrespondence shall not be cut off by the machinations of an envious\nstepmother, who never had attractions to inspire a generous passion;\nand, now that age and wrinkles have destroyed what little share of\nbeauty she once possessed, endeavours, like the fiend in paradise, to\nblast those joys in others, from which she is herself eternally\nexcluded. Doubt not, dear sovereign of my soul! that I will study, with\nall the eagerness of desiring love, how to frustrate her malicious\nintention, and renew those transporting moments, the remembrance of\nwhich now warms the breast of your ever constant FATHOM.”Had our hero murdered her father, or left her a disconsolate widow, by\neffecting the death of her dear husband, there might have been a\npossibility of her exerting the Christian virtues of resignation and\nforgiveness; but such a personal outrage as that contained in this\nepistle precluded all hope of pardon, and rendered penitence of no\nsignification. His atrocious crime being now fully ascertained, this\nvirago gave a loose to her resentment, which became so loud and\ntempestuous, that her informer shuddered at the storm she had raised,\nand began to repent of having communicated the intelligence which\nseemed to have such a violent effect upon hex brain."

In the zenith of her rage, she would have\nhad immediate recourse to poison or steel, had she not been diverted\nfrom her mortal purpose by her counsellor, who represented the danger\nof engaging in such violent measures, and proposed a more secure\nscheme, in the execution of which she would see the perfidious wretch\nsufficiently punished, without any hazard to her own person or\nreputation. She advised her to inform the jeweller of Fathom’s efforts\nto seduce her conjugal fidelity, and impart to him a plan, by which he\nwould have it in his power to detect our adventurer in the very act of\npractising upon her virtue.The lady relished her proposal, and actually resolved to make an\nassignation with Ferdinand, as usual, and give notice of the\nappointment to her husband, that he might personally discover the\ntreachery of his pretended friend, and inflict upon him such\nchastisement as the German’s brutal disposition should suggest, when\ninflamed by that species of provocation. Had this project been brought\nto bear, Ferdinand, in all likelihood, would have been disqualified\nfrom engaging in any future intrigue; but fate ordained that the design\nshould be defeated, in order to reserve him for more important\noccasions.Before the circumstances of the plan could be adjusted, it was his good\nfortune to meet his Dulcinea in the street, and, in the midst of their\nmutual condolence on the interruption they had suffered in their\ncorrespondence, he assured her, that he would never give his invention\nrespite, until he should have verified the protestations contained in\nthe letter he had delivered to her discreet agent. This allusion to a\nbillet she had never received, did not fail to alarm her fears, and\nintroduce a very mortifying explanation, in which he so accurately\ndescribed the person of the messenger, that she forthwith comprehended\nthe plot, and communicated to our hero her sentiments on that subject.Though he expressed infinite anxiety and chagrin at this misfortune,\nwhich could not fail to raise new obstacles to their love, his heart\nwas a stranger to the uneasiness he affected; and rather pleased with\nthe occasion, which would furnish him with pretences to withdraw\nhimself gradually from an intercourse by this time become equally\ncloying and unprofitable. Being well acquainted with the mother’s\ntemperament, he guessed the present situation of her thoughts, and\nconcluding she would make the jeweller a party in her revenge, he\nresolved from that moment to discontinue his visits, and cautiously\nguard against any future interview with the lady whom he had rendered\nso implacable."

Although his penetration was sufficient\nto perceive the drift of this message, or at least to discern the risk\nhe should run in complying with her request, yet he was willing to be\nmore fully certified of the truth of his suspicion, and wrote an answer\nto the billet, in which he assured her, that he would repair to the\nplace of appointment with all the punctuality of an impatient lover.\nNevertheless, instead of performing this promise, he, in the morning,\ntook post in a public-house opposite to the place of assignation, in\norder to reconnoitre the ground, and about noon had the pleasure of\nseeing the German, wrapped in a cloak, enter the door of his wife’s\nshe-friend, though the appointment was fixed at five in the evening.\nFathom blessed his good angel for having conducted him clear of this\nconspiracy, and kept his station with great tranquillity till the hour\nof meeting, when he beheld his enraged Thalestris take the same route,\nand enjoyed her disappointment with ineffable satisfaction.Thus favoured with a pretext, he took his leave of her, in a letter,\ngiving her to understand, that he was no stranger to the barbarous\nsnare she had laid for him; and upbraiding her with having made such an\nungrateful return for all his tenderness and attachment. She was not\nbackward in conveying a reply to this expostulation, which seemed to\nhave been dictated in all the distraction of a proud woman who sees her\nvengeance baffled, as well as her love disdained. Her letter was\nnothing but a succession of reproaches, menaces, and incoherent\nexecrations.

So zealous was he for her spiritual\nconcerns, that he would have been glad to hear she had actually taken\nthe veil; but he knew such a step was not at all agreeable to her\ndisposition, and that no violence would be offered to her inclinations\non that score, unless her stepmother should communicate to the father\nthat letter of Fathom’s which she had intercepted, and by which the\nGerman would be convinced of his daughter’s backsliding; but this\nmeasure, he rightly supposed, the wife would not venture to take, lest\nthe husband, instead of taking her advice touching the young lady,\nshould seek to compromise the affair, by offering her in marriage to\nher debaucher, a proffer which, if accepted, would overwhelm the mother\nwith vexation and despair. He therefore chose to trust to the effects\nof lenient time, which he hoped would gradually weaken the resentment\nof this Penthesilea, and dissolve his connexion with the other parts of\nthe family, from which he longed to be totally detached.How well soever he might have succeeded in his attempts to shake off\nthe yoke of the mother, who by her situation in life was restrained\nfrom prosecuting those measures her resentment had planned against his\nfortitude and indifference, he would have found greater difficulty than\nhe had foreseen, in disengaging himself from the daughter, whose\naffections he had won under the most solemn professions of honour and\nfidelity, and who, now she was debarred of his company and\nconversation, and in danger of losing him for ever, had actually taken\nthe resolution of disclosing the amour to her father, that he might\ninterpose in behalf of her peace and reputation, and secure her\nhappiness by the sanction of the church.CHAPTER EIGHTEENOUR HERO DEPARTS FROM VIENNA, AND QUITS THE DOMAIN OF VENUS FOR THE\nROUGH FIELD OF MARS.Luckily for our adventurer, before she adhered to this determination,\nthe young Count de Melvil was summoned to Presburg by his father, who\ndesired to see him, before he should take the field, in consequence of\na rupture between the Emperor and the French King; and Fathom of course\nquitted Vienna, in order to attend his patron, after he and Renaldo had\nresided two whole years in that capital, where the former had made\nhimself perfect in all the polite exercises, become master of the\nFrench tongue, and learned to speak the Italian with great facility;\nover and above those other accomplishments in which we have represented\nhim as an inimitable original."

  "content": "As for the young Count, his exteriors were so much improved by the\ncompany to which he had access, since his departure from his father’s\nhouse, that his parents were equally surprised and overjoyed at the\nalteration. All that awkwardness and rusticity, which hung upon his\ndeportment, was, like the rough coat of a diamond, polished away; the\nconnexion and disposition of his limbs seemed to have been adjusted\nanew; his carriage was become easy, his air perfectly genteel, and his\nconversation gay and unrestrained. The merit of this reformation was in\na great measure ascribed to the care and example of Mr. Fathom, who was\nreceived by the old Count and his lady with marks of singular\nfriendship and esteem; nor was he overlooked by Mademoiselle, who still\nremained in a state of celibacy, and seemed to have resigned all hope\nof altering her condition; she expressed uncommon satisfaction at the\nreturn of her old favourite, and readmitted him into the same degree of\nfamiliarity with which he had been honoured before his departure.The joy of Teresa was so excessive at his arrival, that she could\nscarce suppress her raptures, so as to conceal them from the notice of\nthe family; and our hero, upon this occasion, performed the part of an\nexquisite actor, in dissembling those transports which his bosom never\nknew. So well had this pupil retained the lessons of her instructor,\nthat, in the midst of those fraudulent appropriations, which she still\ncontinued to make, she had found means to support her interest and\ncharacter with Mademoiselle, and even to acquire such influence in the\nfamily, that no other servant, male or female, could pretend to live\nunder the same roof, without paying incessant homage to this artful\nwaiting-woman, and yielding the most abject submission to her will.The young gentlemen having tarried at Presburg about six weeks, during\nwhich a small field equipage was prepared for Renaldo, they repaired to\nthe camp at Heilbron, under the auspices of Count Melvil, in whose\nregiment they carried arms as volunteers, with a view to merit\npromotion in the service by their own personal behaviour. Our\nadventurer would have willingly dispensed with this occasion of\nsignalising himself, his talents being much better adapted to another\nsphere of life; nevertheless, he affected uncommon alacrity at the\nprospect of gathering laurels in the field, and subscribed to his\nfortune with a good grace; foreseeing, that even in a campaign, a man\nof his art and ingenuity might find means to consult his corporal\nsafety, without any danger to his reputation. Accordingly, before he\nhad lived full three weeks in camp, the damp situation, and sudden\nchange in his way of life, had such a violent effect upon his\nconstitution, that he was deprived of the use of all his limbs, and\nmourned, without ceasing, his hard fate, by which he found himself\nprecluded from all opportunity of exerting his diligence, courage, and\nactivity, in the character of a soldier, to which he now aspired."

  "content": "Renaldo, who was actually enamoured of a martial life, and missed no\noccasion of distinguishing himself, consoled his companion with great\ncordiality, encouraged him with the hope of seeing his constitution\nfamiliarised to the inconveniences of a camp, and accommodated him with\neverything which he thought would alleviate the pain of his body, as\nwell as the anxiety of his mind. The old Count, who sincerely\nsympathised with his affliction, would have persuaded him to retire\ninto quarters, where he could be carefully nursed, and provided with\neverything necessary to a person in his condition; but such was his\ndesire of glory, that he resisted his patron’s importunities with great\nconstancy, till at length, seeing the old gentleman obstinately\ndetermined to consult his health by removing him from the field, he\ngradually suffered himself to recover the use of his hands, made shift\nto sit up in his bed, and amuse himself with cards or backgammon, and,\nnotwithstanding the feeble condition of his legs, ventured to ride out\non horseback to visit the lines, though the Count and his son would\nnever yield to his solicitations so far, as to let him accompany\nRenaldo in those excursions and reconnoitring parties, by which a\nvolunteer inures himself to toil and peril, and acquires that knowledge\nin the operations of war, which qualifies him for a command in the\nservice.Notwithstanding this exemption from all duty, our adventurer managed\nmatters so as to pass for a youth of infinite mettle, and even rendered\nhis backwardness and timidity subservient to the support of that\ncharacter, by expressing an impatience of lying inactive, and a desire\nof signalising his prowess, which even the disabled condition of his\nbody could scarce restrain. He must be a man of very weak nerves and\nexcessive irresolution, who can live in the midst of actual service,\nwithout imbibing some portion of military fortitude: danger becomes\nhabitual, and loses a great part of its terror; and as fear is often\ncaught by contagion, so is courage communicated among the individuals\nof an army. The hope of fame, desire of honours and preferment, envy,\nemulation, and the dread of disgrace, are motives which co-operate in\nsuppressing that aversion to death or mutilation, which nature hath\nimplanted in the human mind; and therefore it is not to be wondered at,\nif Fathom, who was naturally chicken-hearted, gained some advantages\nover his disposition before the end of the campaign, which happened to\nbe neither perilous nor severe."

  "content": "During the winter, while both armies remained in quarters, our\nadventurer attended his patron to Presburg, and, before the troops were\nin motion, Renaldo obtained a commission, in consequence of which he\nwent into garrison at Philipsburg, whither he was followed by our hero,\nwhile the old Count’s duty called him to the field in a different\nplace. Ferdinand for some time had no reason to be dissatisfied with\nthis disposition, by which he was at once delivered from the fatigues\nof a campaign, and the inspection of a severe censor, in the person of\nCount Melvil; and his satisfaction was still increased by an accidental\nmeeting with the Tyrolese who had been his confederate at Vienna, and\nnow chanced to serve in garrison on the same footing with himself.\nThese two knights-errant renewed their former correspondence, and, as\nall soldiers are addicted to gaming, levied contributions upon all\nthose officers who had money to lose, and temerity to play.However, they had not long pursued this branch of traffic, when their\nsuccess was interrupted by a very serious occurrence, that for the\npresent entirely detached the gentlemen in the garrison from such\namusements. The French troops invested Fort Kehl, situated on the\nRhine, opposite to Strasburg; and the Imperialists, dreading that the\nnext storm would fall upon Philipsburg, employed themselves with great\ndiligence to put that important fortress in a proper posture of\ndefence. If the suspension of play was displeasing to our hero, the\nexpectation of being besieged was by no means more agreeable. He knew\nthe excellence of the French engineers, the power of their artillery,\nand the perseverance of their general. He felt, by anticipation, the\ntoils of hard duty upon the works, the horrors of night-alarms,\ncannonading, bombardment, sallies, and mines blown up; and deliberated\nwith himself whether or not he should privately withdraw, and take\nrefuge among the besiegers; but, when he reflected that such a step,\nbesides the infamy that must attend it, would be like that of running\nupon Scylla, seeking to avoid Charybdis, as he would be exposed to more\ndanger and inconvenience in the trenches than he could possibly undergo\nin the town, and after all run the risk of being taken and treated as a\ndeserter; upon these considerations he resolved to submit himself to\nhis destiny, and endeavoured to mitigate the rigour of his fate by\nthose arts he had formerly practised with success. He accordingly found\nmeans to enjoy a very bad state of health during the whole siege, which\nlasted about six weeks after the trenches were opened; and then the\ngarrison marched out by capitulation, with all the honours of war.CHAPTER NINETEENHE PUTS HIMSELF UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF HIS ASSOCIATE, AND STUMBLES UPON\nTHE FRENCH CAMP, WHERE HE FINISHES HIS MILITARY CAREER."

  "content": "Nothing else of moment was transacted during that campaign; and in the\nwinter our adventurer, with the young Count, and his friend the\nTyrolese, were disposed in quarters of cantonment, where Ferdinand made\nhimself amends for the chagrin he had undergone, by the exercise of\nthose talents in which he excelled. Not that he was satisfied with the\nsphere of life in which he acted; though he knew himself consummate in\nthe art of play, he was not at all ambitious of a gamester’s name; nor\ndid he find himself disposed to hazard those discoveries and\nexplanations to which heroes of that class are sometimes necessarily\nexposed. His aim was to dwell among the tents of civil life,\nundisturbed by quarrels and the din of war, and render mankind\nsubservient to his interest, not by stratagems which irritate, but by\nthat suppleness of insinuation, which could not fail to soothe the\ntemper of those on whom he meant to prey.He saw that all his expectations of Count Melvil’s future favour were\nconnected with his choice of a military life; and that his promotion in\nthe service would, in a great measure, depend upon his personal\nbehaviour in such emergencies as he did not at all wish to encounter.\nOn the other hand, he confided so much in his own dexterity and\naddress, that he never doubted of being able to rear a splendid fortune\nfor himself, provided he could once obtain a fixed and firm foundation.\nHe had in fancy often enjoyed a prospect of England, not only as his\nnative country, to which, like a true citizen, he longed to be united;\nbut also as the land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, and\nabounding with subjects on which he knew his talents would be properly\nexercised.These reflections never occurred, without leaving a strong impression\nupon the mind of our adventurer, which influenced his deliberations in\nsuch a manner, as at length amounted to a perfect resolution of\nwithdrawing himself privately from a service that teemed with\ndisagreeable events, and of transporting himself into the country of\nhis ancestors, which he considered as the Canaan of all able\nadventurers. But, previous to his appearance on that stage, he was\ndesirous of visiting the metropolis of France, in which he hoped to\nimprove himself in the knowledge of men and things, and acquire such\nintelligence as would qualify him to act a more important part upon the\nBritish scene. After having for some time indulged these prospects in\nsecret, he determined to accommodate himself with the company and\nexperience of the Tyrolese, whom, under the specious title of an\nassociate, he knew he could convert into a very serviceable tool, in\nforwarding the execution of his own projects."

  "content": "Accordingly, the inclination of this confederate was sounded by distant\nhints, and being found apt, our hero made him privy to his design of\ndecamping without beat of drum; though, at the same time, he begged his\nadvice touching the method of their departure, that he might retire\nwith as much delicacy as the nature of such a step would permit. Divers\nconsultations were held upon this subject, before they adhered to the\nresolution of making their escape from the army, after it should have\ntaken the field in the spring; because, in that case, they would have\nfrequent opportunities of going abroad on foraging parties, and, during\none of these excursions, might retire in such a manner as to persuade\ntheir companions that they had fallen into the enemy’s hands.Agreeable to this determination, the camp was no sooner formed in\nAlsace than our associates began to make preparations for their march,\nand had already taken all the previous measures for their departure,\nwhen an accident happened, which our hero did not fail to convert to\nhis own advantage. This was no other than the desertion of Renaldo’s\nvalet, who, in consequence of a gentle chastisement, which he had\nrichly merited, thought proper to disappear, after having plundered his\nmaster’s portmanteau, which he had forced open for the purpose.\nFerdinand, who was the first person that discovered the theft,\nimmediately comprehended the whole adventure, and, taking it for\ngranted that the delinquent would never return, resolved to finish what\nthe fugitive had imperfectly performed.Being favoured with the unreserved confidence of the young Count, he\ninstantly had recourse to his bureau, the locks of which he found means\nto burst open, and, examining a private drawer, contrived with great\nart to conceal Renaldo’s jewels and cash, made himself master of the\ncontents without hesitation; then cutting open his cloak-bag, and\nstrewing the tent with his linen and clothes, began to raise his voice,\nand produce such a clamour as alarmed the whole neighbourhood, and\nbrought a great many officers into the tent."
