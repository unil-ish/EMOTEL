  "content": "Serafina, accomplished as she was, could not fail to make conquests\namong the Spanish cavaliers, who are famous for sensibility in love.\nIndeed, she never appeared without a numerous train of admirers; and\nthough we had bred her up in that freedom of conversation and\nintercourse which holds a middle space between the French licence and\nSpanish restraint, she was now so much exposed to the addresses of\npromiscuous gallantry, that we found it necessary to retrench the\nliberty of our house, and behave to our male visitants with great\nreserve and circumspection, that our honour and peace might run no risk\nfrom the youth and inexperience of our daughter.This caution produced overtures from a great many young gentlemen of\nrank and distinction, who courted my alliance, by demanding Serafina in\nmarriage; and from the number I had actually selected one person, who\nwas in all respects worthy the possession of such an inestimable prize.\nHis name was Don Manuel de Mendoza. His birth was noble, and his\ncharacter dignified with repeated acts of generosity and virtue. Yet,\nbefore I would signify to him my approbation of his suit, I resolved to\ninform myself whether or not the heart of Serafina was totally\nunengaged, and indifferent to any other object, that I might not lay a\ntyrannical restraint upon her inclinations. The result of my inquiry\nwas a full conviction of her having hitherto been deaf to the voice of\nlove; and this piece of information, together with my own sentiments in\nhis favour, I communicated to Don Manuel, who heard these tidings with\ntransports of gratitude and joy. He was immediately favoured with\nopportunities of acquiring the affection of my daughter, and his\nendeavours were at first received with such respectful civility, as\nmight have been easily warmed into a mutual passion, had not the evil\ngenius of our family interposed.O my friend! how shall I describe the depravity of that unhappy\nvirgin’s sentiments! how recount the particulars of my own dishonour! I\nthat am descended from a long line of illustrious Castilians, who never\nreceived an injury they did not revenge, but washed away every blemish\nin their fame with the blood of those who attempted to stain it! In\nthat circumstance I have imitated the example of my glorious\nprogenitors, and that consideration alone hath supported me against all\nthe assaults of despair."

  "content": "As I grudged no pains and expense in perfecting the education of\nSerafina, my doors were open to every person who made an extraordinary\nfigure in the profession of those amusing sciences in which she\ndelighted. The house of Don Diego de Zelos was a little academy for\npainting, poetry, and music; and Heaven decreed that it should fall a\nsacrifice to its regard for these fatal and delusive arts. Among other\npreceptors, it was her fate to be under the instruction of a cursed\nGerman, who, though his profession was drawing, understood the elements\nand theory of music, possessed a large fund of learning and taste, and\nwas a person remarkable for his agreeable conversation. This traitor,\nwho like you had lost one eye, I not only admitted into my house for\nthe improvement of my daughter, but even distinguished with particular\nmarks of confidence and favour, little thinking he had either\ninclination or capacity to debauch the sentiments of my child. I was\nrejoiced beyond measure to see with what alacrity she received his\nlessons, with what avidity she listened to his discourse, which was\nalways equally moral, instructing, and entertaining.Antonia seemed to vie with me in expressions of regard for this\naccomplished stranger, whom she could not help supposing to be a person\nof rank and family, reduced to his present situation by some\nunfortunate vicissitude of fate. I was disposed to concur with this\nopinion, and actually conjured him to make me his confidant, with such\nprotestations as left him no room to doubt my honour and beneficence;\nbut he still persisted in declaring himself the son of an obscure\nmechanic in Bohemia; an origin to which surely no man would pretend who\nhad the least claim to nobility of birth. While I was thus undeceived\nin my conjecture touching his birth and quality, I was confirmed in an\nopinion of his integrity and moderation, and looked upon him as a man\nof honour, in despite of the lowness of his pedigree. Nevertheless, he\nwas at bottom a most perfidious wretch, and all this modesty and\nself-denial were the effects of the most villanous dissimulation, a\ncloak under which he, unsuspected, robbed me of my honour and my peace.Not to trouble you with particulars, the recital of which would tear my\nheart-strings with indignation and remorse, I shall only observe, that,\nby the power of his infernal insinuation, he fascinated the heart of\nSerafina, brought over Antonia herself to the interests of his passion,\nand at once detached them both from their duty and religion. Heaven and\nearth! how dangerous, how irresistible is the power of infatuation!\nWhile I remained in the midst of this blind security, waiting for the\nnuptials of my daughter, and indulging myself with the vain prospect of\nher approaching felicity, Antonia found means to protract the\nnegotiations of the marriage, by representing that it would be a pity\nto deprive Serafina of the opportunity she then had of profiting by the\nGerman’s instructions; and, upon that account, I prevailed upon Don\nManuel to bridle the impatience of his love."

  "content": "During this interval, as I one evening enjoyed the cool air in my own\ngarden, I was accosted by an old duenna, who had been my nurse and\nlived in the family since the time of my childhood.—“My duty,” said\nshe, “will no longer permit me to wink in silence at the wrongs I see\nyou daily suffer. Dismiss that German from your house without delay, if\nyou respect the glory of your name, and the rights of our holy\nreligion; the stranger is an abominable heretic; and, grant Heaven! he\nmay not have already poisoned the minds of those you hold most dear.” I\nhad been extremely alarmed at the beginning of this address; but,\nfinding the imputation limited to the article of religion, in which,\nthank God, I am no bigot, I recovered my serenity of disposition,\nthanked the old woman for her zeal, commended her piety, and encouraged\nher to persevere in making observations on such subjects as should\nconcern my honour and my quiet.We live in such a world of wickedness and fraud, that a man cannot be\ntoo vigilant in his own defence: had I employed such spies from the\nbeginning, I should in all probability have been at this day in\npossession of every comfort that renders life agreeable. The duenna,\nthus authorised, employed her sagacity with such success, that I had\nreason to suspect the German of a design upon the heart of Serafina;\nbut, as the presumptions did not amount to conviction, I contented\nmyself with exiling him from my house, under the pretext of having\ndiscovered that he was an enemy to the Catholic church; and forthwith\nappointed a day for the celebration of my daughter’s marriage with Don\nManuel de Mendoza. I could easily perceive a cloud of melancholy\noverspread the faces of Serafina and her mother, when I declared these\nmy resolutions; but, as they made no objection to what I proposed, I\ndid not at that time enter into an explanation of the true motives that\ninfluenced my conduct. Both parties were probably afraid of such\nexpostulation.Meanwhile, preparations were made for the espousals of Serafina; and,\nnotwithstanding the anxiety I had undergone, on account of her\nconnexion with the German, I began to think that her duty, her glory,\nhad triumphed over all such low-born considerations, if ever they had\nbeen entertained; because she, and even Antonia, seemed to expect the\nceremony with resignation, though the features of both still retained\nevident marks of concern, which I willingly imputed to the mutual\nprospect of their separation. This, however, was but a faithless calm,\nthat soon, ah! too soon, brought forth a tempest which hath wrecked my\nhopes."

  "content": "Two days before the appointed union of Don Manuel and Serafina, I was\ninformed by the duenna, that, while she accompanied Antonia’s\nwaiting-maid at church, she had seen her receive a billet from an old\nwoman, who, kneeling at her side, had conveyed it in such a mysterious\nmanner, as awakened the duenna’s apprehensions about her young lady;\nshe had therefore hastened home to communicate this piece of\nintelligence, that I might have an opportunity of examining the\nmessenger before she could have time to deposit her trust. I could not\nhelp shivering with fearful presages upon this occasion, and even\nabhorring the person to whose duty and zeal I was beholden for the\nintelligence, even while I endeavoured to persuade myself that the\ninquiry would end in the detection of some paltry intrigue between the\nmaid and her own gallant. I intercepted her in returning from church,\nand, commanding her to follow me to a convenient place, extorted from\nher, by dint of threats, the fatal letter, which I read to this\neffect:—“The whole business of my life, O divine Serafina! will be to repay\nthat affection I have been so happy as to engage. With what transport\nthen shall I obey your summons, in performing that enterprise, which\nwill rescue you from the bed of a detested rival, and put myself in\nfull possession of a jewel which I value infinitely more than life!\nYes, adorable creature! I have provided everything for our escape, and\nat midnight will attend you in your own apartment, from whence you\nshall be conveyed into a land of liberty and peace, where you will,\nunmolested, enjoy the purity of that religion you have espoused, and in\nfull security bless the arms of your ever faithful, ORLANDO.”Were you a fond parent, a tender husband, and a noble Castilian, I\nshould not need to mention the unutterable horrors that took possession\nof my bosom, when I perused this accursed letter, by which I learned\nthe apostasy, disobedience, and degeneracy of my idolised Serafina, who\nhad overthrown and destroyed the whole plan of felicity which I had\nerected, and blasted all the glories of my name; and when the wretched\nmessenger, terrified by my menaces and agitation, confessed that\nAntonia herself was privy to the guilt of her daughter, whom she had\nsolemnly betrothed to that vile German, in the sight of Heaven, and\nthat by her connivance this plebeian intended, that very night, to\nbereave me of my child, I was for some moments stupefied with grief and\namazement, that gave way to an ecstasy of rage, which had well-nigh\nterminated in despair and distraction."

Behold how the drops trickle down my forehead; this\nagony is a fierce and familiar visitant; I shall banish it anon. I\nsummoned my pride, my resentment, to my assistance; these are the\ncordials that support me against all other reflections; those were the\nauxiliaries that enabled me, in the day of trial, to perform that\nsacrifice which my honour demanded, in a strain so loud as to drown the\ncries of nature, love, and compassion. Yes, they espoused that glory\nwhich humanity would have betrayed, and my revenge was noble, though\nunnatural.My scheme was soon laid, my resolution soon taken; I privately confined\nthe wretch who had been the industrious slave of this infamous\nconspiracy, that she might take no step to frustrate or interrupt the\nexecution of my design. Then repairing to the house of an apothecary\nwho was devoted to my service, communicated my intention, which he\ndurst not condemn, and could not reveal, without breaking the oath of\nsecrecy I had imposed; and he furnished me with two vials of poison for\nthe dismal catastrophe I had planned. Thus provided, I, on pretence of\nsudden business at Seville, carefully avoided the dear, the wretched\npair, whom I had devoted to death, that my heart might not relent, by\nmeans of those tender ideas which the sight of them would have\ninfallibly inspired; and, when daylight vanished, took my station near\nthat part of the house through which the villain must have entered on\nhis hellish purpose. There I stood, in a state of horrid expectation,\nmy soul ravaged with the different passions that assailed it, until the\nfatal moment arrived; when I perceived the traitor approach the window\nof a lower apartment, which led into that of Serafina, and gently\nlifting the casement, which was purposely left unsecured, insinuated\nhalf of his body into the house. Then rushing upon him, in a transport\nof fury, I plunged my sword into his heart, crying, “Villain! receive\nthe reward of thy treachery and presumption.”"

O my dear lord! my husband, and\nmy lover! how are our promised joys at once cut off! here, strike, my\nfather! complete your barbarous sacrifice! the spirit of the murdered\nOrlando still hovers for his wife.” These frantic exclamations, in\nwhich she was joined by Antonia, kept up the fury of my resentment,\nwhich by meekness and submission might have been weakened and rendered\nineffectual. “Yes, hapless wretches,” I replied, “ye shall enjoy your\nwish: the honour of my name requires that both shall die; yet I will\nnot mangle the breast of Antonia, on which I have so often reposed; I\nwill not shed the blood of Zelos, nor disfigure the beauteous form of\nSerafina, on which I have so often gazed with wonder and unspeakable\ndelight. Here is an elixir, to which I trust the consummation of my\nrevenge.”So saying, I emptied the vials into separate cups, and, presenting one\nin each hand, the miserable, the fair offenders instantly received the\ndestined draughts, which they drank without hesitation; then praying to\nheaven for the wretched Don Diego, sunk upon the same couch, and\nexpired without a groan.

Powers supreme! does Don Diego\nlive to make this recapitulation? I have done my duty; but ah! I am\nhaunted by the furies of remorse; I am tortured with the incessant\nstings of remembrance and regret; even now the images of my wife and\ndaughter present themselves to my imagination. All the scenes of\nhappiness I have enjoyed as a lover, husband, and parent, all the\nendearing hopes I have cherished, now pass in review before me,\nembittering the circumstances of my inexpressible woe; and I consider\nmyself as a solitary outcast from all the comforts of society. But,\nenough of these unmanly complaints; the yearnings of nature are too\nimportunate.Having completed my vengeance, I retired into my closet, and,\nfurnishing myself with some ready money and jewels of considerable\nvalue, went into the stable, saddled my favourite steed, which I\ninstantly mounted, and, before the tumults of my breast subsided, found\nmyself at the town of St. Lucar. There I learned from inquiry, that\nthere was a Dutch bark in the harbour ready to sail; upon which I\naddressed myself to the master, who, for a suitable gratification, was\nprevailed upon to weigh anchor that same night; so that, embarking\nwithout delay, I soon bid eternal adieu to my native country. It was\nnot from reason and reflection that I took these measures for my\npersonal safety; but, in consequence of an involuntary instinct, that\nseems to operate in the animal machine, while the faculty of thinking\nis suspended.To what a dreadful reckoning was I called, when reason resumed her\nfunction! You may believe me, my friend, when I assure you, that I\nshould not have outlived those tragedies I acted, had I not been\nrestrained from doing violence upon myself by certain considerations,\nwhich no man of honour ought to set aside. I could not bear the thought\nof falling ingloriously by the hand of an executioner, and entailing\ndisgrace upon a family that knew no stain; and I was deterred from\nputting an end to my own misery, by the apprehension of posthumous\ncensure, which would have represented me as a desponding wretch,\nutterly destitute of that patience, fortitude, and resignation, which\nare the characteristics of a true Castilian. I was also influenced by\nreligious motives that suggested to me the necessity of living to\natone, by my sufferings and sorrow, for the guilt I had incurred in\ncomplying with a savage punctilio, which is, I fear, displeasing in the\nsight of Heaven."

In consequence of unfavourable winds, our\nvessel for some days made small progress in her voyage to Holland, and\nnear the coast of Gallicia we were joined by an English ship from Vigo,\nthe master of which gave us to understand, that before he set sail, a\ncourier had arrived from Madrid at that place, with orders for the\ncorregidore to prevent the escape of any native Spaniard by sea from\nany port within his district; and to use his utmost endeavours to\napprehend the person of Don Diego de Zelos, who was suspected of\ntreasonable practices against the state. Such an order, with a minute\ndescription of my person, was at the same time despatched to all the\nseaports and frontier places in Spain.You may easily suppose how I, who was already overwhelmed with\ndistress, could bear this aggravation of misfortune and disgrace: I,\nwho had always maintained the reputation of loyalty, which was acquired\nat the hazard of my life, and the expense of my blood. To deal\ncandidly, I must own, that this intelligence roused me from a lethargy\nof grief which had begun to overpower my faculties. I immediately\nimputed this dishonourable charge to the evil offices of some villain,\nwho had basely taken the advantage of my deplorable situation, and I\nwas inflamed, inspirited with the desire of vindicating my fame, and\nrevenging the injury. Thus animated, I resolved to disguise myself\neffectually from the observation of those spies which every nation\nfinds its account in employing in foreign countries; I purchased this\nhabit from the Dutch navigator, in whose house I kept myself concealed,\nafter our arrival at Amsterdam, until my beard was grown to a\nsufficient length to favour my design, and then appeared as a Persian\ndealer in jewels. As I could gain no satisfactory information touching\nmyself in this country, had no purpose to pursue, and was extremely\nmiserable among a people, who, being mercenary and unsocial, were very\nill adapted to alleviate the horrors of my condition, I gratified my\nlandlord for his important services, with the best part of my effects;\nand having, by his means, procured a certificate from the magistracy,\nrepaired to Rotterdam, from whence I set out in a travelling carriage\nfor Antwerp, on my way to this capital; hoping, with a succession of\ndifferent objects, to mitigate the anguish of my mind, and by the most\nindustrious inquiry, to learn such particulars of that false\nimpeachment, as would enable me to take measures for my own\njustification, as well as for projecting a plan of revenge against the\nvile perfidious author."

Those were literally\ntears of joy, or at least of satisfaction, on both sides; as our hero\nwept with affection and attachment to the jewels that were to be\ncommitted to his care; but, far from discovering the true source of his\ntenderness, he affected to dissuade the Spaniard from parting with the\ndiamonds, which he counselled him to reserve for a more pressing\noccasion; and, in the meantime, earnestly entreated him to depend upon\nhis friendship for present relief.This generous proffer served only to confirm Don Diego’s resolution,\nwhich he forthwith executed, by putting into the hands of Ferdinand\njewels to the value of a thousand crowns, and desiring him to detain\nfor his own use any part of the sum they would raise. Our adventurer\nthanked him for the good opinion he entertained of his integrity, an\nopinion fully manifested in honouring him with such important\nconfidence, and assured him he would transact his affairs with the\nutmost diligence, caution, and despatch. The evening being by this time\nalmost consumed, these new allies retired separately to rest; though\neach passed the night without repose, in very different reflections,\nthe Castilian being, as usual, agitated with the unceasing pangs of his\nunalterable misery, interspersed with gleaming hopes of revenge; and\nFathom being kept awake with revolving plans for turning his\nfellow-lodger’s credulity to his own advantage. From the nature of the\nSpaniard’s situation, he might have appropriated the jewels to himself,\nand remained in Paris without fear of a prosecution, because the\ninjured party had, by the above narrative, left his life and liberty at\ndiscretion.—But he did not think himself secure from the personal\nresentment of an enraged desperate Castilian; and therefore determined\nto withdraw himself privately into that country where he had all along\nproposed to fix the standard of his finesse, which fortune had now\nempowered him to exercise according to his wish."

On this very first day of\nhis arrival, he perceived between the English and the people among whom\nhe had hitherto lived, such essential difference in customs,\nappearance, and way of living, as inspired him with high notions of\nthat British freedom, opulence, and convenience, on which he had often\nheard his mother expatiate. On the road, he feasted his eyesight with\nthe verdant hills covered with flocks of sheep, the fruitful vales\nparcelled out into cultivated enclosures; the very cattle seemed to\nprofit by the wealth of their masters, being large, sturdy, and sleek,\nand every peasant breathed the insolence of liberty and independence.\nIn a word, he viewed the wide-extended plains of Kent with a lover’s\neye, and, his ambition becoming romantic, could not help fancying\nhimself another conqueror of the isle.He was not, however, long amused by these vain chimeras, which soon\nvanished before other reflections of more importance and solidity. His\nimagination, it must be owned, was at all times too chaste to admit\nthose overweening hopes, which often mislead the mind of the projector.\nHe had studied mankind with incredible diligence, and knew perfectly\nwell how far he could depend on the passions and foibles of human\nnature. That he might now act consistent with his former sagacity, he\nresolved to pass himself upon his fellow-travellers for a French\ngentleman, equally a stranger to the language and country of England,\nin order to glean from their discourse such intelligence as might avail\nhim in his future operations; and his lacquey was tutored accordingly.CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTSOME ACCOUNT OF HIS FELLOW-TRAVELLERS.Those who had taken places for the coach, understanding the sixth seat\nwas engaged by a foreigner, determined to profit by his ignorance; and,\nwith that politeness which is peculiar to this happy island, fixed\nthemselves in the vehicle, in such a manner, before he had the least\nintimation of their design, that he found it barely practicable to\ninsinuate himself sidelong between a corpulent quaker and a fat Wapping\nlandlady, in which attitude he stuck fast, like a thin quarto between\ntwo voluminous dictionaries on a bookseller’s shelf. And, as if the\npain and inconvenience of such compression was not sufficient matter of\nchagrin, the greatest part of the company entertained themselves with\nlaughing at his ludicrous station."

Sirrah! my\ncorporation is made up of good, wholesome, English fat; but you are\npuffed up with the wind of vanity and delusion; and when it begins to\ngripe your entrails, you pretend to have a motion, and then get up and\npreach nonsense. Yet you’ll take it upon you to call your betters\nchildren. Marry come up, Mr. Goosecap, I have got children that are as\ngood men as you, or any hypocritical trembler in England.”A person who sat opposite to the quaker, hearing this remonstrance,\nwhich seemed pregnant with contention, interposed in the conversation\nwith a conscious leer, and begged there might be no rupture between the\nspirit and the flesh. By this remonstrance he relieved Obadiah from the\nsatire of this female orator, and brought the whole vengeance of her\nelocution upon his own head. “Flesh!” cried she, with all the ferocity\nof an enraged Thalestris; “none of your names, Mr. Yellowchaps. What! I\nwarrant you have an antipathy to flesh, because you yourself are\nnothing but skin and bone. I suppose you are some poor starved\njourneyman tailor come from France, where you have been learning to\ncabbage, and have not seen a good meal of victuals these seven years.\nYou have been living upon rye-bread and soup-maigre, and now you come\nover like a walking atomy with a rat’s tail at your wig, and a tinsey\njacket. And so, forsooth, you set up for a gentleman, and pretend to\nfind fault with a sirloin of roast beef.”"

Since when, I pray, have you travelled in\nstage-coaches, and left off your old profession of crying oysters in\nwinter, and rotten mackerel in June? You was then known by the name of\nKate Brawn, and in good repute among the ale-houses in Thames Street,\ntill that unlucky amour with the master of a corn-vessel, in which he\nwas unfortunately detected by his own spouse; but you seem to have\nrisen by that fall; and I wish you joy of your present plight. Though,\nconsidering your education on Bear Quay, you can give but a sorry\naccount of yourself.”The Amazon, though neither exhausted nor dismayed, was really\nconfounded at the temper and assurance of this antagonist, who had\ngathered all these anecdotes from the fertility of his own invention;\nafter a short pause, however, she poured forth a torrent of obloquy\nsufficient to overwhelm any person who had not been used to take up\narms against such seas of trouble; and a dispute ensued, which would\nhave not only disgraced the best orators on the Thames, but even have\nmade a figure in the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries, during\nwhich the Athenian matrons rallied one another from different waggons,\nwith that freedom of altercation so happily preserved in this our age\nand country."

  "content": "Such a redundancy of epithets, and variety of metaphors, tropes, and\nfigures were uttered between these well-matched opponents, that an epic\nbard would have found his account in listening to the contest; which,\nin all probability, would not have been confined to words, had it not\nbeen interrupted for the sake of a young woman of an agreeable\ncountenance and modest carriage; who, being shocked at some of their\nflowers of speech, and terrified by the menacing looks and gestures of\nthe fiery-featured dame, began to scream aloud, and beg leave to quit\nthe coach. Her perturbation put an end to the high debate. The sixth\npassenger, who had not opened his mouth, endeavoured to comfort her\nwith assurances of protection; the quaker proposed a cessation of arms;\nthe male disputant acquiesced in the proposal, assuring the company he\nhad entered the lists for their entertainment only, without acquiring\nthe least grudge or ill-will to the fat gentlewoman, whom he protested\nhe had never seen before that day, and who, for aught he knew, was a\nperson of credit and reputation. He then held forth his hand in token\nof amity, and asked pardon of the offended party, who was appeased by\nhis submission; and, in testimony of her benevolence, presented to the\nother female, whom she had discomposed, an Hungary-water bottle filled\nwith cherry-brandy, recommending it as a much more powerful remedy than\nthe sal-volatile which the other held to her nose.Peace being thus re-established, in a treaty comprehending Obadiah and\nall present, it will not be improper to give the reader some further\ninformation, touching the several characters assembled in this vehicle.\nThe quaker was a London merchant, who had been at Deal superintending\nthe repairs of a ship which had suffered by a storm in the Downs. The\nWapping landlady was on her return from the same place, where she had\nattended the payment of a man-of-war, with sundry powers of attorney,\ngranted by the sailors, who had lived upon credit at her house. Her\ncompetitor in fame was a dealer in wine, a smuggler of French lace, and\na petty gamester just arrived from Paris, in the company of an English\nbarber, who sat on his right hand, and the young woman was daughter of\na country curate, in her way to London, where she was bound apprentice\nto a milliner.Hitherto Fathom had sat in silent astonishment at the manners of his\nfellow-travellers, which far exceeded the notions he had preconceived\nof English plainness and rusticity. He found himself a monument of that\ndisregard and contempt which a stranger never fails to meet with from\nthe inhabitants of this island; and saw, with surprise, an agreeable\nyoung creature sit as solitary and unheeded as himself.He was, indeed, allured by the roses of her complexion, and the\ninnocence of her aspect, and began to repent of having pretended\nignorance of the language, by which he was restrained from exercising\nhis eloquence upon her heart; he resolved, however, to ingratiate\nhimself, if possible, by the courtesy and politeness of dumb show, and\nfor that purpose put his eyes in motion without farther delay.CHAPTER TWENTY-NINEANOTHER PROVIDENTIAL DELIVERANCE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE SMUGGLER’S\nINGENIOUS CONJECTURE."

  "content": "During these deliberations, the wine merchant, with a view to make a\nparade of his superior parts and breeding, as well as to pave the way\nfor a match at backgammon, made a tender of his snuff-box to our\nadventurer, and asked, in bad French, how he travelled from Paris. This\nquestion produced a series of interrogations concerning the place of\nFerdinand’s abode in that city, and his business in England, so that he\nwas fain to practise the science of defence, and answered with such\nambiguity, as aroused the suspicion of the smuggler, who began to\nbelieve our hero had some very cogent reason for evading his curiosity;\nhe immediately set his reflection at work, and, after various\nconjectures, fixed upon Fathom’s being the Young Pretender. Big with\nthis supposition, he eyed him with the most earnest attention,\ncomparing his features with those of the Chevalier’s portrait which he\nhad seen in France, and though the faces were as unlike as any two\nhuman faces could be, found the resemblance so striking as to dispel\nall his doubts, and persuade him to introduce the stranger to some\njustice on the road; a step by which he would not only manifest his\nzeal for the Protestant succession, but also acquire the splendid\nreward proposed by parliament to any person who should apprehend that\nfamous adventurer.These ideas intoxicated the brain of this man to such a pitch of\nenthusiasm, that he actually believed himself in possession of the\nthirty thousand pounds, and amused his fancy with a variety of\nmagnificent projects to be executed by means of that acquisition, until\nhis reverie was interrupted by the halting of the coach at the inn\nwhere the passengers used to eat their breakfasts. Waked as he was from\nthe dream of happiness, it had made such impression upon his mind,\nthat, seeing Fathom rise up with an intention to alight, he took it for\ngranted his design was to escape, and seizing him by the collar, called\naloud for assistance in the King’s name.Our hero, whose sagacity and presence of mind very often supplied the\nplace of courage, instead of being terrified at this assault, which\nmight have disturbed the tranquillity of an ordinary villain, was so\nperfectly master of every circumstance of his own situation, as to know\nat once that the aggressor could not possibly have the least cause of\ncomplaint against him; and therefore, imputing this violence either to\nmadness or mistake, very deliberately suffered himself to be made\nprisoner by the people of the house, who ran to the coach door in\nobedience to the summons of the wine merchant. The rest of the company\nwere struck dumb with surprise and consternation at this sudden\nadventure; and the quaker, dreading some fell resistance on the side of\nthe outlandish man, unpinned the other coach door in the twinkling of\nan eye, and trundled himself into the mud for safety. The others,\nseeing the temper and resignation of the prisoner, soon recovered their\nrecollection, and began to inquire into the cause of his arrest, upon\nwhich, the captor, whose teeth chattered with terror and impatience,\ngave them to understand that he was a state criminal, and demanded\ntheir help in conveying him to justice."

In this order did the procession\nadvance to the apartment in which the magistrate, with his fellows of\nthe chase, sat smoking his morning pipe over a tankard of strong ale,\nand the smuggler being directed to the right person, “May it please\nyour worship,” said he, “I have brought this foreigner before you, on a\nviolent suspicion of his being a proclaimed outlaw; and I desire,\nbefore these witnesses, that my title may be made good to the reward\nthat shall become due upon his conviction.”“Friend,” replied the justice, “I know nothing of you or your titles;\nbut this I know, if you have any information to give in, you must come\nto my house when I am at home, and proceed in a lawful way, that is,\nd’ye mind me, if you swear as how this here person is an outlaw; then\nif so be as he has nothing to say to the contrary, my clerk shall make\nout a mittimus, and so to jail with him till next ’size.” “But, sir,”\nanswered the impeacher, “this is a case that admits of no delay; the\nperson I have apprehended is a prisoner of consequence to the state.”\n“How, fellor!” cried the magistrate, interrupting him, “is there any\nperson of more consequence than one of his Majesty’s justices of the\npeace, who is besides a considerable member of the landed interest!\nD’ye know, sirrah, who you are talking to? If you don’t go about your\nbusiness, I believe I shall lay you by the heels.”The smuggler, fearing his prize would escape through the ignorance,\npride, and obstinacy of this country justice, approached his worship,\nand in a whisper which was overheard by all the company, assured him he\nhad indubitable reason to believe the foreigner was no other than the\nPretender’s eldest son. At mention of this formidable name, every\nindividual of the audience started, with signs of terror and amazement.\nThe justice dropped his pipe, recoiled upon his chair, and, looking\nmost ridiculously aghast, exclaimed, “Seize him, in the name of God and\nhis Majesty King George! Has he got no secret arms about him!”"

This request was interpreted by the accuser,\nwho, at the same time, laid claim to the booty. The justice took charge\nof the deposit, and one of his neighbours having undertaken the office\nof clerk, he proceeded to the examination of the culprit, whose papers\nwere by this time laid on the table before him. “Stranger,” said he,\n“you stand charged with being son of the Pretender to these realms;\nwhat have you to say in your own defence?” Our hero assured him, in the\nFrench language, that he was falsely impeached, and demanded justice on\nthe accuser, who, without the least reason, had made such a malicious\nattack upon the life and honour of an innocent gentleman.The smuggler, instead of acting the part of a faithful interpreter,\ntold his worship, that the prisoner’s answer was no more than a simple\ndenial, which every felon would make who had nothing else to plead in\nhis own behalf, and that this alone was a strong presumption of his\nguilt, because, if he was not really the person they suspected him to\nbe, the thing would speak for itself, for, if he was not the Young\nPretender, who then was he? This argument had great weight with the\njustice, who, assuming a very important aspect, observed, “Very true,\nfriend, if you are not the Pretender, in the name of God, who are you?\nOne may see with half an eye that he is no better than a promiscuous\nfellow.”Ferdinand now began to repent of having pretended ignorance of the\nEnglish language, as he found himself at the mercy of a rascal, who put\na false gloss upon all his words, and addressed himself to the audience\nsuccessively in French, High Dutch, Italian, and Hungarian Latin,\ndesiring to know if any person present understood any of these tongues,\nthat his answers might be honestly explained to the bench. But he might\nhave accosted them in Chinese with the same success: there was not one\nperson present tolerably versed in his mother-tongue, much less\nacquainted with any foreign language, except the wine merchant, who,\nincensed at this appeal, which he considered as an affront to his\nintegrity, gave the judge to understand, that the delinquent, instead\nof speaking to the purpose, contumaciously insulted his authority in\nsundry foreign lingos, which he apprehended was an additional proof of\nhis being the Chevalier’s son, inasmuch as no person would take the\npains to learn such a variety of gibberish, except with some sinister\nintent."
