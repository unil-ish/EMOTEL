  "content": "Uncle Herbert, with his spiky grey hair. Aunt Alberta, who twisted her\nmouth so unpleasantly in talking and had a great reputation for\nunselfishness because she was always giving up a lot of things she\ndidn’t want. Valancy let them off easily in her judgment because she\nliked them, even if they were in Milton’s expressive phrase, “stupidly\ngood.” But she wondered for what inscrutable reason Aunt Alberta had\nseen fit to tie a black velvet ribbon around each of her chubby arms\nabove the elbow.Then she looked across the table at Olive. Olive, who had been held up\nto her as a paragon of beauty, behaviour and success as long as she\ncould remember. “Why can’t you hold yourself like Olive, Doss? Why\ncan’t you stand correctly like Olive, Doss? Why can’t you speak\nprettily like Olive, Doss? Why can’t you make an effort, Doss?”Valancy’s elfin eyes lost their mocking glitter and became pensive and\nsorrowful. You could not ignore or disdain Olive. It was quite\nimpossible to deny that she was beautiful and effective and sometimes\nshe was a little intelligent. Her mouth might be a trifle heavy—she\nmight show her fine, white, regular teeth rather too lavishly when she\nsmiled. But when all was said and done, Olive justified Uncle\nBenjamin’s summing up—“a stunning girl.” Yes, Valancy agreed in her\nheart, Olive was stunning.Rich, golden-brown hair, elaborately dressed, with a sparkling bandeau\nholding its glossy puffs in place; large, brilliant blue eyes and thick\nsilken lashes; face of rose and bare neck of snow, rising above her\ngown; great pearl bubbles in her ears; the blue-white diamond flame on\nher long, smooth, waxen finger with its rosy, pointed nail. Arms of\nmarble, gleaming through green chiffon and shadow lace. Valancy felt\nsuddenly thankful that her own scrawny arms were decently swathed in\nbrown silk. Then she resumed her tabulation of Olive’s charms.Tall. Queenly. Confident. Everything that Valancy was _not_. Dimples,\ntoo, in cheeks and chin. “A woman with dimples always gets her own\nway,” thought Valancy, in a recurring spasm of bitterness at the fate\nwhich had denied her even one dimple."

  "content": "Olive was only a year younger than Valancy, though a stranger would\nhave thought that there was at least ten years between them. But nobody\never dreaded old maidenhood for her. Olive had been surrounded by a\ncrowd of eager beaus since her early teens, just as her mirror was\nalways surrounded by a fringe of cards, photographs, programmes and\ninvitations. At eighteen, when she had graduated from Havergal College,\nOlive had been engaged to Will Desmond, lawyer in embryo. Will Desmond\nhad died and Olive had mourned for him properly for two years. When she\nwas twenty-three she had a hectic affair with Donald Jackson. But Aunt\nand Uncle Wellington disapproved of that and in the end Olive dutifully\ngave him up. Nobody in the Stirling clan—whatever outsiders might\nsay—hinted that she did so because Donald himself was cooling off.\nHowever that might be, Olive’s third venture met with everybody’s\napproval. Cecil Price was clever and handsome and “one of the Port\nLawrence Prices.” Olive had been engaged to him for three years. He had\njust graduated in civil engineering and they were to be married as soon\nas he landed a contract. Olive’s hope chest was full to overflowing\nwith exquisite things and Olive had already confided to Valancy what\nher wedding-dress was to be. Ivory silk draped with lace, white satin\ncourt train, lined with pale green georgette, heirloom veil of Brussels\nlace. Valancy knew also—though Olive had not told her—that the\nbridesmaids were selected and that she was not among them.Valancy had, after a fashion, always been Olive’s confidante—perhaps\nbecause she was the only girl in the connection who could not bore\nOlive with return confidences. Olive always told Valancy all the\ndetails of her love affairs, from the days when the little boys in\nschool used to “persecute” her with love letters. Valancy could not\ncomfort herself by thinking these affairs mythical. Olive really had\nthem. Many men had gone mad over her besides the three fortunate ones.“I don’t know what the poor idiots see in me, that drives them to make\nsuch double idiots of themselves,” Olive was wont to say. Valancy would\nhave liked to say, “I don’t either,” but truth and diplomacy both\nrestrained her. She _did_ know, perfectly well. Olive Stirling was one\nof the girls about whom men do go mad just as indubitably as she,\nValancy, was one of the girls at whom no man ever looked twice.“And yet,” thought Valancy, summing her up with a new and merciless\nconclusiveness, “she’s like a dewless morning. There’s _something_\nlacking.”CHAPTER XI"

  "content": "Meanwhile the dinner in its earlier stages was dragging its slow length\nalong true to Stirling form. The room was chilly, in spite of the\ncalendar, and Aunt Alberta had the gas-logs lighted. Everybody in the\nclan envied her those gas-logs except Valancy. Glorious open fires\nblazed in every room of her Blue Castle when autumnal nights were cool,\nbut she would have frozen to death in it before she would have\ncommitted the sacrilege of a gas-log. Uncle Herbert made his hardy\nperennial joke when he helped Aunt Wellington to the cold meat—“Mary,\nwill you have a little lamb?” Aunt Mildred told the same old story of\nonce finding a lost ring in a turkey’s crop. Uncle Benjamin told _his_\nfavourite prosy tale of how he had once chased and punished a now\nfamous man for stealing apples. Second Cousin Jane described all her\nsufferings with an ulcerating tooth. Aunt Wellington admired the\npattern of Aunt Alberta’s silver teaspoons and lamented the fact that\none of her own had been lost.“It spoiled the set. I could never get it matched. And it was my\nwedding-present from dear old Aunt Matilda.”Aunt Isabel thought the seasons were changing and couldn’t imagine what\nhad become of our good, old-fashioned springs. Cousin Georgiana, as\nusual, discussed the last funeral and wondered, audibly, “which of us\nwill be the next to pass away.” Cousin Georgiana could never say\nanything as blunt as “die.” Valancy thought she could tell her, but\ndidn’t. Cousin Gladys, likewise as usual, had a grievance. Her visiting\nnephews had nipped all the buds off her house-plants and chivied her\nbrood of fancy chickens—“squeezed some of them actually to death, my\ndear.”“Boys will be boys,” reminded Uncle Herbert tolerantly.“But they needn’t be ramping, rampageous animals,” retorted Cousin\nGladys, looking round the table for appreciation of her wit. Everybody\nsmiled except Valancy. Cousin Gladys remembered that. A few minutes\nlater, when Ellen Hamilton was being discussed, Cousin Gladys spoke of\nher as “one of those shy, plain girls who can’t get husbands,” and\nglanced significantly at Valancy.Uncle James thought the conversation was sagging to a rather low plane\nof personal gossip. He tried to elevate it by starting an abstract\ndiscussion on “the greatest happiness.” Everybody was asked to state\nhis or her idea of “the greatest happiness.”"

  "content": "Aunt Mildred thought the greatest happiness—for a woman—was to be “a\nloving and beloved wife and mother.” Aunt Wellington thought it would\nbe to travel in Europe. Olive thought it would be to be a great singer\nlike Tetrazzini. Cousin Gladys remarked mournfully that _her_ greatest\nhappiness would be to be free—absolutely free—from neuritis. Cousin\nGeorgiana’s greatest happiness would be “to have her dear, dead brother\nRichard back.” Aunt Alberta remarked vaguely that the greatest\nhappiness was to be found in “the poetry of life” and hastily gave some\ndirections to her maid to prevent any one asking her what she meant.\nMrs. Frederick said the greatest happiness was to spend your life in\nloving service for others, and Cousin Stickles and Aunt Isabel agreed\nwith her—Aunt Isabel with a resentful air, as if she thought Mrs.\nFrederick had taken the wind out of her sails by saying it first. “We\nare all too prone,” continued Mrs. Frederick, determined not to lose so\ngood an opportunity, “to live in selfishness, worldliness and sin.” The\nother women all felt rebuked for their low ideals, and Uncle James had\na conviction that the conversation had been uplifted with a vengeance.“The greatest happiness,” said Valancy suddenly and distinctly, “is to\nsneeze when you want to.”Everybody stared. Nobody felt it safe to say anything. Was Valancy\ntrying to be funny? It was incredible. Mrs. Frederick, who had been\nbreathing easier since the dinner had progressed so far without any\noutbreak on the part of Valancy, began to tremble again. But she deemed\nit the part of prudence to say nothing. Uncle Benjamin was not so\nprudent. He rashly rushed in where Mrs. Frederick feared to tread.“Doss,” he chuckled, “what is the difference between a young girl and\nan old maid?”“One is happy and careless and the other is cappy and hairless,” said\nValancy. “You have asked that riddle at least fifty times in my\nrecollection, Uncle Ben. Why don’t you hunt up some new riddles if\nriddle you _must_? It is such a fatal mistake to try to be funny if you\ndon’t succeed.”Uncle Benjamin stared foolishly. Never in his life had he, Benjamin\nStirling, of Stirling and Frost, been spoken to so. And by Valancy of\nall people! He looked feebly around the table to see what the others\nthought of it. Everybody was looking rather blank. Poor Mrs. Frederick\nhad shut her eyes. And her lips moved tremblingly—as if she were\npraying. Perhaps she was. The situation was so unprecedented that\nnobody knew how to meet it. Valancy went on calmly eating her salad as\nif nothing out of the usual had occurred.Aunt Alberta, to save her dinner, plunged into an account of how a dog\nhad bitten her recently. Uncle James, to back her up, asked where the\ndog had bitten her.“Just a little below the Catholic church,” said Aunt Alberta.At that point Valancy laughed. Nobody else laughed. What was there to\nlaugh at?“Is that a vital part?” asked Valancy.“What do you mean?” said bewildered Aunt Alberta, and Mrs. Frederick\nwas almost driven to believe that she had served God all her years for\nnaught.Aunt Isabel concluded that it was up to her to suppress Valancy."

Do you\n_ever_ try to fatten up a little?”“No.” Valancy was not asking quarter or giving it. “But I can tell you\nwhere you’ll find a beauty parlor in Port Lawrence where they can\nreduce the number of your chins.”“_Val-an-cy_!” The protest was wrung from Mrs. Frederick. She meant her\ntone to be stately and majestic, as usual, but it sounded more like an\nimploring whine. And she did not say “Doss.”“She’s feverish,” said Cousin Stickles to Uncle Benjamin in an agonised\nwhisper. “We’ve thought she’s seemed feverish for several days.”“She’s gone dippy, in my opinion,” growled Uncle Benjamin. “If not, she\nought to be spanked. Yes, spanked.”“You can’t spank her.” Cousin Stickles was much agitated. “She’s\ntwenty-nine years old.”“So there is that advantage, at least, in being twenty-nine,” said\nValancy, whose ears had caught this aside.“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, “when I am dead you may say what you\nplease. As long as I am alive I demand to be treated with respect.”“Oh, but you know we’re all dead,” said Valancy, “the whole Stirling\nclan. Some of us are buried and some aren’t—yet. That is the only\ndifference.”“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, thinking it might cow Valancy, “do you\nremember the time you stole the raspberry jam?”Valancy flushed scarlet—with suppressed laughter, not shame. She had\nbeen sure Uncle Benjamin would drag that jam in somehow.“Of course I do,” she said. “It was good jam. I’ve always been sorry I\nhadn’t time to eat more of it before you found me. Oh, _look_ at Aunt\nIsabel’s profile on the wall. Did you ever see anything so funny?”Everybody looked, including Aunt Isabel herself, which of course,\ndestroyed it. But Uncle Herbert said kindly, “I—I wouldn’t eat any more\nif I were you, Doss. It isn’t that I grudge it—but don’t you think it\nwould be better for yourself? Your—your stomach seems a little out of\norder.”“Don’t worry about my stomach, old dear,” said Valancy. “It is all\nright. I’m going to keep right on eating. It’s so seldom I get the\nchance of a satisfying meal.”"

  "content": "It was the first time any one had been called “old dear” in Deerwood.\nThe Stirlings thought Valancy had invented the phrase and they were\nafraid of her from that moment. There was something so uncanny about\nsuch an expression. But in poor Mrs. Frederick’s opinion the reference\nto a satisfying meal was the worst thing Valancy had said yet. Valancy\nhad always been a disappointment to her. Now she was a disgrace. She\nthought she would have to get up and go away from the table. Yet she\ndared not leave Valancy there.Aunt Alberta’s maid came in to remove the salad plates and bring in the\ndessert. It was a welcome diversion. Everybody brightened up with a\ndetermination to ignore Valancy and talk as if she wasn’t there. Uncle\nWellington mentioned Barney Snaith. Eventually somebody did mention\nBarney Snaith at every Stirling function, Valancy reflected. Whatever\nhe was, he was an individual that could not be ignored. She resigned\nherself to listen. There was a subtle fascination in the subject for\nher, though she had not yet faced this fact. She could feel her pulses\nbeating to her finger-tips.Of course they abused him. Nobody ever had a good word to say of Barney\nSnaith. All the old, wild tales were canvassed—the defaulting\ncashier-counterfeiter-infidel-murderer-in-hiding legends were thrashed\nout. Uncle Wellington was very indignant that such a creature should be\nallowed to exist at all in the neighbourhood of Deerwood. He didn’t\nknow what the police at Port Lawrence were thinking of. Everybody would\nbe murdered in their beds some night. It was a shame that he should be\nallowed to be at large after all that he had done.“What _has_ he done?” asked Valancy suddenly.Uncle Wellington stared at her, forgetting that she was to be ignored.“Done! Done! He’s done _everything_.”“_What_ has he done?” repeated Valancy inexorably. “What do you _know_\nthat he has done? You’re always running him down. And what has ever\nbeen proved against him?”“I don’t argue with women,” said Uncle Wellington. “And I don’t need\nproof. When a man hides himself up there on an island in Muskoka, year\nin and year out, and nobody can find out where he came from or how he\nlives, or what he does there, _that’s_ proof enough. Find a mystery and\nyou find a crime.”“The very idea of a man named Snaith!” said Second Cousin Sarah. “Why,\nthe name itself is enough to condemn him!”“I wouldn’t like to meet him in a dark lane,” shivered Cousin\nGeorgiana.“What do you suppose he would do to you?” asked Valancy."

  "content": "“Murder me,” said Cousin Georgiana solemnly.“Just for the fun of it?” suggested Valancy.“Exactly,” said Cousin Georgiana unsuspiciously. “When there is so much\nsmoke there must be some fire. I was afraid he was a criminal when he\ncame here first. I _felt_ he had something to hide. I am not often\nmistaken in my intuitions.”“Criminal! Of course he’s a criminal,” said Uncle Wellington. “Nobody\ndoubts it”—glaring at Valancy. “Why, they say he served a term in the\npenitentiary for embezzlement. I don’t doubt it. And they say he’s in\nwith that gang that are perpetrating all those bank robberies round the\ncountry.”“_Who_ say?” asked Valancy.Uncle Wellington knotted his ugly forehead at her. What had got into\nthis confounded girl, anyway? He ignored the question.“He has the identical look of a jail-bird,” snapped Uncle Benjamin. “I\nnoticed it the first time I saw him.”“‘A fellow by the hand of nature marked,\nQuoted and signed to do a deed of shame’,”declaimed Uncle James. He looked enormously pleased over managing to\nwork that quotation in at last. He had been waiting all his life for\nthe chance.“One of his eyebrows is an arch and the other is a triangle,” said\nValancy. “Is _that_ why you think him so villainous?”Uncle James lifted _his_ eyebrows. Generally when Uncle James lifted\nhis eyebrows the world came to an end. This time it continued to\nfunction.“How do _you_ know his eyebrows so well, Doss?” asked Olive, a trifle\nmaliciously. Such a remark would have covered Valancy with confusion\ntwo weeks ago, and Olive knew it.“Yes, how?” demanded Aunt Wellington.“I’ve seen him twice and I looked at him closely,” said Valancy\ncomposedly. “I thought his face the most interesting one I ever saw.”“There is no doubt there is something fishy in the creature’s past\nlife,” said Olive, who began to think she was decidedly out of the\nconversation, which had centred so amazingly around Valancy. “But he\ncan hardly be guilty of _everything_ he’s accused of, you know.”"

  "content": "Valancy felt annoyed with Olive. Why should _she_ speak up in even this\nqualified defence of Barney Snaith? What had _she_ to do with him? For\nthat matter, what had Valancy? But Valancy did not ask herself this\nquestion.“They say he keeps dozens of cats in that hut up back on Mistawis,”\nsaid Second Cousin Sarah Taylor, by way of appearing not entirely\nignorant of him.Cats. It sounded quite alluring to Valancy, in the plural. She pictured\nan island in Muskoka haunted by pussies.“That alone shows there is something wrong with him,” decreed Aunt\nIsabel.“People who don’t like cats,” said Valancy, attacking her dessert with\na relish, “always seem to think that there is some peculiar virtue in\nnot liking them.”“The man hasn’t a friend except Roaring Abel,” said Uncle Wellington.\n“And if Roaring Abel had kept away from him, as everybody else did, it\nwould have been better for—for some members of his family.”Uncle Wellington’s rather lame conclusion was due to a marital glance\nfrom Aunt Wellington reminding him of what he had almost forgotten—that\nthere were girls at the table.“If you mean,” said Valancy passionately, “that Barney Snaith is the\nfather of Cecily Gay’s child, he _isn’t_. It’s a wicked lie.”In spite of her indignation Valancy was hugely amused at the expression\nof the faces around that festal table. She had not seen anything like\nit since the day, seventeen years ago, when at Cousin Gladys’ thimble\nparty, they discovered that she had got—SOMETHING—in her head at\nschool. _Lice_ in her head! Valancy was done with euphemisms.Poor Mrs. Frederick was almost in a state of collapse. She had\nbelieved—or pretended to believe—that Valancy still supposed that\nchildren were found in parsley beds.“Hush—hush!” implored Cousin Stickles.“I don’t mean to hush,” said Valancy perversely. “I’ve hush—hushed all\nmy life. I’ll scream if I want to. Don’t make me want to. And stop\ntalking nonsense about Barney Snaith.”"

  "content": "Valancy didn’t exactly understand her own indignation. What did Barney\nSnaith’s imputed crimes and misdemeanours matter to her? And why, out\nof them all, did it seem most intolerable that he should have been\npoor, pitiful little Cecily Gay’s false lover? For it _did_ seem\nintolerable to her. She did not mind when they called him a thief and a\ncounterfeiter and jail-bird; but she could not endure to think that he\nhad loved and ruined Cecily Gay. She recalled his face on the two\noccasions of their chance meetings—his twisted, enigmatic, engaging\nsmile, his twinkle, his thin, sensitive, almost ascetic lips, his\ngeneral air of frank daredeviltry. A man with such a smile and lips\nmight have murdered or stolen but he could not have betrayed. She\nsuddenly hated every one who said it or believed it of him.“When _I_ was a young girl I never thought or spoke about such matters,\nDoss,” said Aunt Wellington, crushingly.“But I’m not a young girl,” retorted Valancy, uncrushed. “Aren’t you\nalways rubbing that into me? And you are all evil-minded, senseless\ngossips. Can’t you leave poor Cissy Gay alone? She’s dying. Whatever\nshe did, God or the Devil has punished her enough for it. _You_ needn’t\ntake a hand, too. As for Barney Snaith, the only crime he has been\nguilty of is living to himself and minding his own business. He can, it\nseems, get along without you. Which _is_ an unpardonable sin, of\ncourse, in your little snobocracy.” Valancy coined that concluding word\nsuddenly and felt that it was an inspiration. That was exactly what\nthey were and not one of them was fit to mend another.“Valancy, your poor father would turn over in his grave if he could\nhear you,” said Mrs. Frederick.“I dare say he would like that for a change,” said Valancy brazenly.“Doss,” said Uncle James heavily, “the Ten Commandments are fairly up\nto date still—especially the fifth. Have you forgotten that?”“No,” said Valancy, “but I thought _you_ had—especially the ninth. Have\nyou ever thought, Uncle James, how dull life would be without the Ten\nCommandments? It is only when things are forbidden that they become\nfascinating.”But her excitement had been too much for her. She knew, by certain\nunmistakable warnings, that one of her attacks of pain was coming on.\nIt must not find her there. She rose from her chair.“I am going home now. I only came for the dinner. It was very good,\nAunt Alberta, although your salad-dressing is not salt enough and a\ndash of cayenne would improve it.”None of the flabbergasted silver wedding guests could think of anything\nto say until the lawn gate clanged behind Valancy in the dusk. Then—“She’s feverish—I’ve said right along she was feverish,” moaned Cousin\nStickles.Uncle Benjamin punished his pudgy left hand fiercely with his pudgy\nright."

Poppy-cock!” snorted Uncle Benjamin. “I never heard a young\nwoman talk such stuff in my life as she just did. Talking about things\nshe ought to be ashamed to think of, much less mention. Blaspheming!\nInsulting _us_! What she wants is a generous dose of spank-weed and I’d\nlike to be the one to administer it.

All her defences were down.“I must tell you,” she sobbed, “that Valancy has been acting very\nstrangely for over two weeks now. She hasn’t been a bit like\nherself—Christine could tell you. I have hoped against hope that it was\nonly one of her colds coming on. But it is—it must be something worse.”“This is bringing on my neuritis again,” said Cousin Gladys, putting\nher hand to her head.“Don’t cry, Amelia,” said Herbert kindly, pulling nervously at his\nspiky grey hair. He hated “family ructions.” Very inconsiderate of Doss\nto start one at _his_ silver wedding. Who could have supposed she had\nit in her? “You’ll have to take her to a doctor. This may be only\na—er—a brainstorm. There are such things as brainstorms nowadays,\naren’t there?”“I—I suggested consulting a doctor to her yesterday,” moaned Mrs.\nFrederick. “And she said she wouldn’t go to a doctor—wouldn’t.

I noticed it _before_\ntoday.” (Uncle Benjamin was thinking of “m-i-r-a-z-h.”) “Everything she\nsaid today showed an unbalanced mind. That question—‘Was it a vital\npart?’ Was there any sense at all in that remark? None whatever! There\nnever was anything like that in the Stirlings. It must be from the\nWansbarras.”Poor Mrs. Frederick was too crushed to be indignant.“I never heard of anything like that in the Wansbarras,” she sobbed.“Your father was odd enough,” said Uncle Benjamin.“Poor Pa was—peculiar,” admitted Mrs. Frederick tearfully, “but his\nmind was never affected.”“He talked all his life exactly as Valancy did today,” retorted Uncle\nBenjamin. “And he believed he was his own great-great grandfather born\nover again. I’ve heard him say it. Don’t tell _me_ that a man who\nbelieved a thing like _that_ was ever in his right senses. Come, come,\nAmelia, stop sniffling. Of course Doss has made a terrible exhibition\nof herself today, but she’s not responsible. Old maids are apt to fly\noff at a tangent like that.

I’ll take her over to see Dr. Marsh\ntomorrow. _I_ know how to deal with pig-headed people. Won’t that be\nbest, James?”“We must have medical advice certainly,” agreed Uncle James.“Well, that’s settled. In the meantime, Amelia, act as if nothing had\nhappened and keep an eye on her.

The attack she had when she thankfully reached the shelter of\nher own room was the worst yet. It was really very bad. She might die\nin one of those spells. It would be dreadful to die in such pain.\nPerhaps—perhaps this was death. Valancy felt pitifully alone. When she\ncould think at all she wondered what it would be like to have some one\nwith her who could sympathise—some one who really cared—just to hold\nher hand tight, if nothing else—some one just to say, “Yes, I know.\nIt’s dreadful—be brave—you’ll soon be better;” not some one merely\nfussy and alarmed. Not her mother or Cousin Stickles. Why did the\nthought of Barney Snaith come into her mind? Why did she suddenly feel,\nin the midst of this hideous loneliness of pain, that _he_ would be\nsympathetic—sorry for any one that was suffering? Why did he seem to\nher like an old, well-known friend? Was it because she had been\ndefending him—standing up to her family for him?"

The pain left her and she lay on her bed, spent,\nexhausted, in a cold perspiration. Oh, that had been horrible! She\ncould not endure many more attacks like that. One didn’t mind dying if\ndeath could be instant and painless. But to be hurt so in dying!Suddenly she found herself laughing. That dinner _had_ been fun. And it\nhad all been so simple. She had merely _said_ the things she had always\n_thought_. Their faces—oh, their faces! Uncle Benjamin—poor,\nflabbergasted Uncle Benjamin! Valancy felt quite sure he would make a\nnew will that very night. Olive would get Valancy’s share of his fat\nhoard. Olive had always got Valancy’s share of everything. Remember the\ndust-pile.To laugh at her clan as she had always wanted to laugh was all the\nsatisfaction she could get out of life now. But she thought it was\nrather pitiful that it should be so. Might she not pity herself a\nlittle when nobody else did?Valancy got up and went to her window. The moist, beautiful wind\nblowing across groves of young-leafed wild trees touched her face with\nthe caress of a wise, tender, old friend. The lombardies in Mrs.\nTredgold’s lawn, off to the left—Valancy could just see them between\nthe stable and the old carriage-shop—were in dark purple silhouette\nagainst a clear sky and there was a milk-white, pulsating star just\nover one of them, like a living pearl on a silver-green lake. Far\nbeyond the station were the shadowy, purple-hooded woods around Lake\nMistawis. A white, filmy mist hung over them and just above it was a\nfaint, young crescent. Valancy looked at it over her thin left\nshoulder.“I wish,” she said whimsically, “that I may have _one_ little dust-pile\nbefore I die.”CHAPTER XIIIUncle Benjamin found he had reckoned without his host when he promised\nso airily to take Valancy to a doctor. Valancy would not go. Valancy\nlaughed in his face.“Why on earth should I go to Dr. Marsh? There’s nothing the matter with\nmy mind. Though you all think I’ve suddenly gone crazy. Well, I\nhaven’t. I’ve simply grown tired of living to please other people and\nhave decided to please myself. It will give you something to talk about\nbesides my stealing the raspberry jam. So that’s that.”"

I remember\nGrandfather Wansbarra. He was one of the few human beings I _have_\nknown—almost the only one. Now, it is of no use to scold or entreat or\ncommand, Uncle Benjamin—or exchange anguished glances with Mother and\nCousin Stickles. I am not going to any doctor. And if you bring any\ndoctor here I won’t see him. So what are you going to do about it?”What indeed! It was not seemly—or even possible—to hale Valancy\ndoctorwards by physical force. And in no other way could it be done,\nseemingly. Her mother’s tears and imploring entreaties availed not.“Don’t worry, Mother,” said Valancy, lightly but quite respectfully.\n“It isn’t likely I’ll do anything very terrible. But I mean to have a\nlittle fun.”“Fun!” Mrs. Frederick uttered the word as if Valancy had said she was\ngoing to have a little tuberculosis.Olive, sent by her mother to see if _she_ had any influence over\nValancy, came away with flushed cheeks and angry eyes. She told her\nmother that nothing could be done with Valancy. After _she_, Olive, had\ntalked to her just like a sister, tenderly and wisely, all Valancy had\nsaid, narrowing her funny eyes to mere slips, was, “_I_ don’t show my\ngums when I laugh.”“More as if she were talking to herself than to me. Indeed, Mother, all\nthe time I was talking to her she gave me the impression of not really\nlistening. And that wasn’t all. When I finally decided that what I was\nsaying had no influence over her I begged her, when Cecil came next\nweek, not to say anything queer before him, at least. Mother, what do\nyou think she said?”“I’m sure I can’t imagine,” groaned Aunt Wellington, prepared for\nanything.“She said, ‘I’d rather like to shock Cecil. His mouth is too red for a\nman’s.’ Mother, I can never feel the same to Valancy again.”"

They were all there except\nCousin Gladys, who had been suffering such tortures of neuritis in her\nhead “ever since poor Doss went queer” that she couldn’t undertake any\nresponsibility. They decided—that is, they accepted a fact that was\nthrust in their faces—that the wisest thing was to leave Valancy alone\nfor a while—“give her her head” as Uncle Benjamin expressed it—“keep a\ncareful eye on her but let her pretty much alone.” The term of\n“watchful waiting” had not been invented then, but that was practically\nthe policy Valancy’s distracted relatives decided to follow.“We must be guided by developments,” said Uncle Benjamin. “It\nis”—solemnly—“easier to scramble eggs than unscramble them. Of\ncourse—if she becomes violent——”Uncle James consulted Dr. Ambrose Marsh. Dr. Ambrose Marsh approved\ntheir decision. He pointed out to irate Uncle James—who would have\nliked to lock Valancy up somewhere, out of hand—that Valancy had not,\nas yet, really done or said anything that could be construed as proof\nof lunacy—and without proof you cannot lock people up in this\ndegenerate age. Nothing that Uncle James had reported seemed very\nalarming to Dr. Marsh, who put up his hand to conceal a smile several\ntimes. But then he himself was not a Stirling. And he knew very little\nabout the old Valancy. Uncle James stalked out and drove back to\nDeerwood, thinking that Ambrose Marsh wasn’t much of a doctor, after\nall, and that Adelaide Stirling might have done better for herself.CHAPTER XIV"

Mrs. Frederick, in her systematic\nway, had long ago appointed the second week in June for the repairing\nof the front porch, the roof of which was sagging dangerously. Roaring\nAbel had been engaged to do it many moons before and Roaring Abel\npromptly appeared on the morning of the first day of the second week,\nand fell to work. Of course he was drunk. Roaring Abel was never\nanything but drunk. But he was only in the first stage, which made him\ntalkative and genial. The odour of whisky on his breath nearly drove\nMrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles wild at dinner. Even Valancy, with\nall her emancipation, did not like it. But she liked Abel and she liked\nhis vivid, eloquent talk, and after she washed the dinner dishes she\nwent out and sat on the steps and talked to him.Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles thought it a terrible proceeding,\nbut what could they do? Valancy only smiled mockingly at them when they\ncalled her in, and did not go. It was so easy to defy once you got\nstarted. The first step was the only one that really counted. They were\nboth afraid to say anything more to her lest she might make a scene\nbefore Roaring Abel, who would spread it all over the country with his\nown characteristic comments and exaggerations. It was too cold a day,\nin spite of the June sunshine, for Mrs. Frederick to sit at the\ndining-room window and listen to what was said. She had to shut the\nwindow and Valancy and Roaring Abel had their talk to themselves. But\nif Mrs. Frederick had known what the outcome of that talk was to be she\nwould have prevented it, if the porch was never repaired.Valancy sat on the steps, defiant of the chill breeze of this cold June\nwhich had made Aunt Isabel aver the seasons were changing. She did not\ncare whether she caught a cold or not. It was delightful to sit there\nin that cold, beautiful, fragrant world and feel free. She filled her\nlungs with the clean, lovely wind and held out her arms to it and let\nit tear her hair to pieces while she listened to Roaring Abel, who told\nher his troubles between intervals of hammering gaily in time to his\nScotch songs. Valancy liked to hear him. Every stroke of his hammer\nfell true to the note."

His tremendous beard, falling down over\nhis blue flannel shirt, was still a flaming, untouched red, though his\nshock of hair was white as snow, and his eyes were a fiery, youthful\nblue. His enormous, reddish-white eyebrows were more like moustaches\nthan eyebrows. Perhaps this was why he always kept his upper lip\nscrupulously shaved. His cheeks were red and his nose ought to have\nbeen, but wasn’t. It was a fine, upstanding, aquiline nose, such as the\nnoblest Roman of them all might have rejoiced in. Abel was six feet two\nin his stockings, broad-shouldered, lean-hipped. In his youth he had\nbeen a famous lover, finding all women too charming to bind himself to\none. His years had been a wild, colourful panorama of follies and\nadventures, gallantries, fortunes and misfortunes. He had been\nforty-five before he married—a pretty slip of a girl whom his goings-on\nkilled in a few years. Abel was piously drunk at her funeral and\ninsisted on repeating the fifty-fifth chapter of Isaiah—Abel knew most\nof the Bible and all the Psalms by heart—while the minister, whom he\ndisliked, prayed or tried to pray. Thereafter his house was run by an\nuntidy old cousin who cooked his meals and kept things going after a\nfashion. In this unpromising environment little Cecilia Gay had grown\nup.Valancy had known “Cissy Gay” fairly well in the democracy of the\npublic school, though Cissy had been three years younger than she.\nAfter they left school their paths diverged and she had seen nothing of\nher. Old Abel was a Presbyterian. That is, he got a Presbyterian\npreacher to marry him, baptise his child and bury his wife; and he knew\nmore about Presbyterian theology than most ministers, which made him a\nterror to them in arguments. But Roaring Abel never went to church.\nEvery Presbyterian minister who had been in Deerwood had tried his\nhand—once—at reforming Roaring Abel. But he had not been pestered of\nlate. Rev. Mr. Bently had been in Deerwood for eight years, but he had\nnot sought out Roaring Abel since the first three months of his\npastorate. He had called on Roaring Abel then and found him in the\ntheological stage of drunkenness—which always followed the sentimental\nmaudlin one, and preceded the roaring, blasphemous one. The eloquently\nprayerful one, in which he realised himself temporarily and intensely\nas a sinner in the hands of an angry God, was the final one. Abel never\nwent beyond it. He generally fell asleep on his knees and awakened\nsober, but he had never been “dead drunk” in his life. He told Mr.\nBently that he was a sound Presbyterian and sure of his election. He\nhad no sins—that he knew of—to repent of.“Have you never done anything in your life that you are sorry for?”\nasked Mr. Bently.Roaring Abel scratched his bushy white head and pretended to reflect.\n“Well, yes,” he said finally. “There were some women I might have\nkissed and didn’t. I’ve always been sorry for _that_.”Mr. Bently went out and went home."

The church people took her up and she was in turn a member\nof the Mission Band, the Girls’ Guild and the Young Women’s Missionary\nSociety. She was a faithful, unobtrusive, sincere, little worker.\nEverybody liked Cissy Gay and was sorry for her. She was so modest and\nsensitive and pretty in that delicate, elusive fashion of beauty which\nfades so quickly if life is not kept in it by love and tenderness. But\nthen liking and pity did not prevent them from tearing her in pieces\nlike hungry cats when the catastrophe came. Four years previously Cissy\nGay had gone up to a Muskoka hotel as a summer waitress. And when she\nhad come back in the fall she was a changed creature. She hid herself\naway and went nowhere. The reason soon leaked out and scandal raged.\nThat winter Cissy’s baby was born. Nobody ever knew who the father was.\nCecily kept her poor pale lips tightly locked on her sorry secret.\nNobody dared ask Roaring Abel any questions about it. Rumour and\nsurmise laid the guilt at Barney Snaith’s door because diligent inquiry\namong the other maids at the hotel revealed the fact that nobody there\nhad ever seen Cissy Gay “with a fellow.” She had “kept herself to\nherself” they said, rather resentfully. “Too good for _our_ dances. And\nnow look!”The baby had lived for a year. After its death Cissy faded away. Two\nyears ago Dr. Marsh had given her only six months to live—her lungs\nwere hopelessly diseased. But she was still alive. Nobody went to see\nher. Women would not go to Roaring Abel’s house. Mr. Bently had gone\nonce, when he knew Abel was away, but the dreadful old creature who was\nscrubbing the kitchen floor told him Cissy wouldn’t see any one. The\nold cousin had died and Roaring Abel had had two or three disreputable\nhousekeepers—the only kind who could be prevailed on to go to a house\nwhere a girl was dying of consumption. But the last one had left and\nRoaring Abel had now no one to wait on Cissy and “do” for him. This was\nthe burden of his plaint to Valancy and he condemned the “hypocrites”\nof Deerwood and its surrounding communities with some rich, meaty oaths\nthat happened to reach Cousin Stickles’ ears as she passed through the\nhall and nearly finished the poor lady. Was Valancy listening to\n_that_?Valancy hardly noticed the profanity. Her attention was focussed on the\nhorrible thought of poor, unhappy, disgraced little Cissy Gay, ill and\nhelpless in that forlorn old house out on the Mistawis road, without a\nsoul to help or comfort her. And this in a nominally Christian\ncommunity in the year of grace nineteen and some odd!“Do you mean to say that Cissy is all alone there now, with nobody to\ndo anything for her—_nobody_?”“Oh, she can move about a bit and get a bite and sup when she wants it.\nBut she can’t work. It’s d——d hard for a man to work hard all day and\ngo home at night tired and hungry and cook his own meals. Sometimes I’m\nsorry I kicked old Rachel Edwards out.” Abel described Rachel\npicturesquely."

She’d made some punkin jam—had it on\nthe table in glass jars with the tops off. The dawg got up on the table\nand stuck his paw into one of them. What did she do? She jest took holt\nof the dawg and wrung the syrup off his paw back into the jar! Then\nscrewed the top on and set it in the pantry. I sets open the door and\nsays to her, ‘Go!’ The dame went, and I fired the jars of punkin after\nher, two at a time.

She’s told everywhere I’m crazy, so\nnobody’ll come for love or money.”“But Cissy _must_ have some one to look after her,” insisted Valancy,\nwhose mind was centred on this aspect of the case. She did not care\nwhether Roaring Abel had any one to cook for him or not. But her heart\nwas wrung for Cecilia Gay.“Oh, she gits on. Barney Snaith always drops in when he’s passing and\ndoes anything she wants done. Brings her oranges and flowers and\nthings. There’s a Christian for you. Yet that sanctimonious, snivelling\nparcel of St. Andrew’s people wouldn’t be seen on the same side of the\nroad with him. Their dogs’ll go to heaven before they do. And their\nminister—slick as if the cat had licked him!”“There are plenty of good people, both in St. Andrew’s and St.\nGeorge’s, who would be kind to Cissy if you would behave yourself,”\nsaid Valancy severely. “They’re afraid to go near your place.”“Because I’m such a sad old dog? But I don’t bite—never bit any one in\nmy life. A few loose words spilled around don’t hurt any one. And I’m\nnot asking people to come. Don’t want ’em poking and prying about. What\nI want is a housekeeper. If I shaved every Sunday and went to church\nI’d get all the housekeepers I’d want. I’d be respectable then. But\nwhat’s the use of going to church when it’s all settled by\npredestination? Tell me that, Miss.”“Is it?” said Valancy.“Yes. Can’t git around it nohow. Wish I could. I don’t want either\nheaven or hell for steady. Wish a man could have ’em mixed in equal\nproportions.”“Isn’t that the way it is in this world?” said Valancy\nthoughtfully—but rather as if her thought was concerned with something\nelse than theology.“No, no,” boomed Abel, striking a tremendous blow on a stubborn nail.\n“There’s too much hell here—entirely too much hell. That’s why I get\ndrunk so often. It sets you free for a little while—free from\nyourself—yes, by God, free from predestination. Ever try it?”“No, I’ve another way of getting free,” said Valancy absently. “But\nabout Cissy now. She _must_ have some one to look after her——”"
