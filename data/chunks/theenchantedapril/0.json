Small mediaeval\n    Italian Castle on the shores of the Mediterranean to be Let\n    Furnished for the month of April. Necessary servants remain. Z,\n    Box 1000, _The Times_.That was its conception; yet, as in the case of many another, the\nconceiver was unaware of it at the moment.So entirely unaware was Mrs. Wilkins that her April for that year had\nthen and there been settled for her that she dropped the newspaper with\na gesture that was both irritated and resigned, and went over to the\nwindow and stared drearily out at the dripping street."

  "content": "Not for her were mediaeval castles, even those that are specially\ndescribed as small. Not for her the shores in April of the\nMediterranean, and the wistaria and sunshine. Such delights were only\nfor the rich. Yet the advertisement had been addressed to persons who\nappreciate these things, so that it had been, anyhow, addressed too\nto her, for she certainly appreciated them; more than anybody knew;\nmore than she had ever told. But she was poor. In the whole world she\npossessed of her very own only ninety pounds, saved from year to year,\nput by carefully pound by pound, out of her dress allowance. She had\nscraped this sum together at the suggestion of her husband as a shield\nand refuge against a rainy day. Her dress allowance, given her by her\nfather, was £100 a year, so that Mrs. Wilkins’s clothes were what\nher husband, urging her to save, called modest and becoming, and her\nacquaintance to each other, when they spoke of her at all, which was\nseldom for she was very negligible, called a perfect sight.Mr. Wilkins, a solicitor, encouraged thrift, except that branch of it\nwhich got into his food. He did not call that thrift, he called it bad\nhousekeeping. But for the thrift which, like moth, penetrated into Mrs.\nWilkins’s clothes and spoilt them, he had much praise. “You never\nknow,” he said, “when there will be a rainy day, and you may be very\nglad to find you have a nest-egg. Indeed we both may.”Looking out of the club window into Shaftesbury Avenue—hers was an\neconomical club, but convenient for Hampstead, where she lived, and for\nShoolbred’s, where she shopped—Mrs. Wilkins, having stood there some\ntime very drearily, her mind’s eye on the Mediterranean in April, and\nthe wistaria, and the enviable opportunities of the rich, while her\nbodily eye watched the really extremely horrible sooty rain falling\nsteadily on the hurrying umbrellas and splashing omnibuses, suddenly\nwondered whether perhaps this was not the rainy day Mellersh—Mellersh\nwas Mr. Wilkins—had so often encouraged her to prepare for, and whether\nto get out of such a climate and into the small mediaeval castle wasn’t\nperhaps what Providence had all along intended her to do with her\nsavings. Part of her savings, of course; perhaps quite a small part.\nThe castle, being mediaeval, might also be dilapidated, and\ndilapidations were surely cheap. She wouldn’t in the least mind a few\nof them, because you didn’t pay for dilapidations which were already\nthere; on the contrary—by reducing the price you had to pay they really\npaid you. But what nonsense to think of it . . ."

  "content": "She turned away from the window with the same gesture of mingled\nirritation and resignation with which she had laid down _The Times_,\nand crossed the room towards the door with the intention of getting her\nmackintosh and umbrella and fighting her way into one of the\novercrowded omnibuses and going to Shoolbred’s on her way home and\nbuying some soles for Mellersh’s dinner—Mellersh was difficult with\nfish and liked only soles, except salmon—when she beheld Mrs.\nArbuthnot, a woman she knew by sight as also living in Hampstead and\nbelonging to the club, sitting at the table in the middle of the room\non which the newspapers and magazines were kept, absorbed, in her turn,\nin the first page of _The Times_.Mrs. Wilkins had never yet spoken to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who belonged to\none of the various church sets, and who analysed, classified, divided\nand registered the poor; whereas she and Mellersh, when they did go\nout, went to the parties of impressionist painters, of whom in\nHampstead there were many. Mellersh had a sister who had married one of\nthem and lived up on the Heath, and because of this alliance Mrs.\nWilkins was drawn into a circle which was highly unnatural to her, and\nshe had learned to dread pictures. She had to say things about them,\nand she didn’t know what to say. She used to murmur, “Marvellous,” and\nfeel that it was not enough. But nobody minded. Nobody listened. Nobody\ntook any notice of Mrs. Wilkins. She was the kind of person who is not\nnoticed at parties. Her clothes, infested by thrift, made her\npractically invisible; her face was non-arresting; her conversation was\nreluctant; she was shy. And if one’s clothes and face and conversation\nare all negligible, thought Mrs. Wilkins, who recognised her\ndisabilities, what, at parties, is there left of one?Also she was always with Wilkins, that clean-shaven, fine-looking man,\nwho gave a party, merely by coming to it, a great air. Wilkins was\nvery respectable. He was known to be highly thought of by his senior\npartners. His sister’s circle admired him. He pronounced adequately\nintelligent judgments on art and artists. He was pithy; he was prudent;\nhe never said a word too much, nor, on the other hand, did he ever\nsay a word too little. He produced the impression of keeping copies\nof everything he said; and he was so obviously reliable that it often\nhappened that people who met him at these parties became discontented\nwith their own solicitors, and after a period of restlessness\nextricated themselves and went to Wilkins."

  "content": "Naturally Mrs. Wilkins was blotted out. “She,” said his sister, with\nsomething herself of the judicial, the digested, and the final in her\nmanner, “should stay at home.” But Wilkins could not leave his wife at\nhome. He was a family solicitor, and all such have wives and show them.\nWith his in the week he went to parties, and with his on Sundays he\nwent to church. Being still fairly young—he was thirty-nine—and\nambitious of old ladies, of whom he had not yet acquired in his\npractice a sufficient number, he could not afford to miss church, and\nit was there that Mrs. Wilkins became familiar, though never through\nwords, with Mrs. Arbuthnot.She saw her marshalling the children of the poor into pews. She would\ncome in at the head of the procession from the Sunday School exactly\nfive minutes before the choir, and get her boys and girls neatly fitted\ninto their allotted seats, and down on their little knees in their\npreliminary prayer, and up again on their feet just as, to the swelling\norgan, the vestry door opened, and the choir and clergy, big with the\nlitanies and commandments they were presently to roll out, emerged. She\nhad a sad face, yet she was evidently efficient. The combination used\nto make Mrs. Wilkins wonder, for she had been told by Mellersh, on days\nwhen she had only been able to get plaice, that if one were efficient\none wouldn’t be depressed, and that if one does one’s job well one\nbecomes automatically bright and brisk.About Mrs. Arbuthnot there was nothing bright and brisk, though much in\nher way with the Sunday School children that was automatic; but when\nMrs. Wilkins, turning from the window, caught sight of her in the club\nshe was not being automatic at all, but was looking fixedly at one\nportion of the first page of _The Times_, holding the paper quite\nstill, her eyes not moving. She was just staring; and her face, as\nusual, was the face of a patient and disappointed Madonna.Obeying an impulse she wondered at even while obeying it, Mrs. Wilkins,\nthe shy and the reluctant, instead of proceeding as she had intended to\nthe cloakroom and from thence to Schoolbred’s in search of Mellersh’s\nfish, stopped at the table and sat down exactly opposite Mrs.\nArbuthnot, to whom she had never yet spoken in her life.It was one of those long, narrow refectory tables, so that they were\nquite close to each other.Mrs. Arbuthnot, however, did not look up. She continued to gaze, with\neyes that seemed to be dreaming, at one spot only of The Times."

  "content": "Mrs. Wilkins watched her a minute, trying to screw up courage to speak\nto her. She wanted to ask her if she had seen the advertisement. She\ndid not know why she wanted to ask her this, but she wanted to. How\nstupid not to be able to speak to her. She looked so kind. She looked\nso unhappy. Why couldn’t two unhappy people refresh each other on their\nway through this dusty business of life by a little talk—real, natural\ntalk, about what they felt, what they would have liked, what they still\ntried to hope? And she could not help thinking that Mrs. Arbuthnot,\ntoo, was reading that very same advertisement. Her eyes were on the\nvery part of the paper. Was she, too, picturing what it would be\nlike—the colour, the fragrance, the light, the soft lapping of the sea\namong little hot rocks? Colour, fragrance, light, sea; instead of\nShaftesbury Avenue, and the wet omnibuses, and the fish department at\nShoolbred’s, and the Tube to Hampstead, and dinner, and to-morrow the\nsame and the day after the same and always the same . . .Suddenly Mrs. Wilkins found herself leaning across the table. “Are you\nreading about the mediaeval castle and the wistaria?” she heard herself\nasking.Naturally Mrs. Arbuthnot was surprised; but she was not half so much\nsurprised as Mrs. Wilkins was at herself for asking.Mrs. Arbuthnot had not yet to her knowledge set eyes on the shabby,\nlank, loosely-put-together figure sitting opposite her, with its small\nfreckled face and big grey eyes almost disappearing under a\nsmashed-down wet-weather hat, and she gazed at her a moment without\nanswering. She _was_ reading about the mediaeval castle and the\nwistaria, or rather had read about it ten minutes before, and since\nthen had been lost in dreams—of light, of colour, of fragrance, of the\nsoft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks . . .“Why do you ask me that?” she said in her grave voice, for her training\nof and by the poor had made her grave and patient.Mrs. Wilkins flushed and looked excessively shy and frightened. “Oh,\nonly because I saw it too, and I thought perhaps—I thought somehow—”\nshe stammered.Whereupon Mrs. Arbuthnot, her mind being used to getting people into\nlists and divisions, from habit considered, as she gazed thoughtfully\nat Mrs. Wilkins, under what heading, supposing she had to classify her,\nshe could most properly be put.“And I know you by sight,” went on Mrs. Wilkins, who, like all the shy,\nonce she was started plunged on, frightening herself to more and more\nspeech by the sheer sound of what she had said last in her ears. “Every\nSunday—I see you every Sunday in church—”“In church?” echoed Mrs. Arbuthnot.“And this seems such a wonderful thing—this advertisement about the\nwistaria—and—”Mrs. Wilkins, who must have been at least thirty, broke off and\nwriggled in her chair with the movement of an awkward and embarrassed\nschoolgirl.“It seems _so_ wonderful,” she went on in a kind of burst, “and—it is\nsuch a miserable day . . .”"

  "content": "And then she sat looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot with the eyes of an\nimprisoned dog.“This poor thing,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose life was spent in\nhelping and alleviating, “needs advice.”She accordingly prepared herself patiently to give it.“If you see me in church,” she said, kindly and attentively, “I suppose\nyou live in Hampstead too?”“Oh yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins. And she repeated, her head on its long\nthin neck drooping a little as if the recollection of Hampstead bowed\nher, “Oh yes.”“Where?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, who, when advice was needed, naturally\nfirst proceeded to collect the facts.But Mrs. Wilkins, laying her hand softly and caressingly on the part\nof _The Times_ where the advertisement was, as though the mere printed\nwords of it were precious, only said, “Perhaps that’s why _this_ seems\nso wonderful.”“No—I think _that’s_ wonderful anyhow,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, forgetting\nfacts and faintly sighing.“Then you _were_ reading it?”“Yes,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, her eyes going dreamy again.“Wouldn’t it be wonderful?” murmured Mrs. Wilkins.“Wonderful,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. Her face, which had lit up, faded\ninto patience again. “Very wonderful,” she said. “But it’s no use\nwasting one’s time thinking of such things.”“Oh, but it _is_,” was Mrs. Wilkins’s quick, surprising reply;\nsurprising because it was so much unlike the rest of her—the\ncharacterless coat and skirt, the crumpled hat, the undecided wisp of\nhair straggling out. “And just the considering of them is worth while\nin itself—such a change from Hampstead—and sometimes I believe—I really\ndo believe—if one considers hard enough one gets things.”Mrs. Arbuthnot observed her patiently. In what category would she,\nsupposing she had to, put her?“Perhaps,” she said, leaning forward a little, “you will tell me your\nname. If we are to be friends”—she smiled her grave smile—“as I hope we\nare, we had better begin at the beginning.”"

  "content": "“Oh yes—how kind of you. I’m Mrs. Wilkins,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “I don’t\nexpect,” she added, flushing, as Mrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, “that it\nconveys anything to you. Sometimes it—it doesn’t seem to convey\nanything to me either. But”—she looked round with a movement of seeking\nhelp—“I _am_ Mrs. Wilkins.”She did not like her name. It was a mean, small name, with a kind of\nfacetious twist, she thought, about its end like the upward curve of a\npugdog’s tail. There it was, however. There was no doing anything with\nit. Wilkins she was and Wilkins she would remain; and though her\nhusband encouraged her to give it on all occasions as Mrs.\nMellersh-Wilkins she only did that when he was within earshot, for she\nthought Mellersh made Wilkins worse, emphasising it in the way\nChatsworth on the gate-posts of a villa emphasises the villa.When first he suggested she should add Mellersh she had objected for\nthe above reason, and after a pause—Mellersh was much too prudent to\nspeak except after a pause, during which presumably he was taking a\ncareful mental copy of his coming observation—he said, much displeased,\n“But I am not a villa,” and looked at her as he looks who hopes, for\nperhaps the hundredth time, that he may not have married a fool.Of course he was not a villa, Mrs. Wilkins assured him; she had never\nsupposed he was; she had not dreamed of meaning . . . she was only just\nthinking . . .The more she explained the more earnest became Mellersh’s hope,\nfamiliar to him by this time, for he had then been a husband for two\nyears, that he might not by any chance have married a fool; and they\nhad a prolonged quarrel, if that can be called a quarrel which is\nconducted with dignified silence on one side and earnest apology on the\nother, as to whether or no Mrs. Wilkins had intended to suggest that\nMr. Wilkins was a villa.“I believe,” she had thought when it was at last over—it took a long\nwhile—“that _anybody_ would quarrel about _anything_ when they’ve not\nleft off being together for a single day for two whole years. What we\nboth need is a holiday.”“My husband,” went on Mrs. Wilkins to Mrs. Arbuthnot, trying to throw\nsome light on herself, “is a solicitor. He—” She cast about for\nsomething she could say elucidatory of Mellersh, and found: “He’s very\nhandsome.”"

  "content": "“Well,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot kindly, “that must be a great pleasure to\nyou.”“Why?” asked Mrs. Wilkins.“Because,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, a little taken aback, for constant\nintercourse with the poor had accustomed her to have her pronouncements\naccepted without question, “because beauty—handsomeness—is a gift like\nany other, and if it is properly used—”She trailed off into silence. Mrs. Wilkins’s great grey eyes were fixed\non her, and it seemed suddenly to Mrs. Arbuthnot that perhaps she was\nbecoming crystallised into a habit of exposition, and of exposition\nafter the manner of nursemaids, through having an audience that\ncouldn’t but agree, that would be afraid, if it wished, to interrupt,\nthat didn’t know, that was, in fact, at her mercy.But Mrs. Wilkins was not listening; for just then, absurd as it seemed,\na picture had flashed across her brain, and there were two figures in\nit sitting together under a great trailing wistaria that stretched\nacross the branches of a tree she didn’t know, and it was herself and\nMrs. Arbuthnot—she saw them—she saw them. And behind them, bright in\nsunshine, were old grey walls—the mediaeval castle—she saw it—they\nwere there . . .She therefore stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot and did not hear a word she\nsaid. And Mrs. Arbuthnot stared too at Mrs. Wilkins, arrested by the\nexpression on her face, which was swept by the excitement of what she\nsaw, and was as luminous and tremulous under it as water in sunlight\nwhen it is ruffled by a gust of wind. At this moment, if she had been\nat a party, Mrs. Wilkins would have been looked at with interest.They stared at each other; Mrs. Arbuthnot surprised, inquiringly, Mrs.\nWilkins with the eyes of some one who has had a revelation. Of course.\nThat was how it could be done. She herself, she by herself, couldn’t\nafford it, and wouldn’t be able, even if she could afford it, to go\nthere all alone; but she and Mrs. Arbuthnot together . . .She leaned across the table. “Why don’t we try and get it?” she\nwhispered.Mrs. Arbuthnot became even more wide-eyed. “Get it?” she repeated."

  "content": "“Yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins, still as though she were afraid of being\noverheard. “Not just sit here and say How wonderful, and then go home\nto Hampstead without having put out a finger—go home just as usual and\nsee about the dinner and the fish just as we’ve been doing for years\nand years and will go on doing for years and years. In fact,” said Mrs.\nWilkins, flushing to the roots of her hair, for the sound of what she\nwas saying, of what was coming pouring out, frightened her, and yet she\ncouldn’t stop, “I see no end to it. There is no end to it. So that\nthere ought to be a break, there ought to be intervals—in everybody’s\ninterests. Why, it would really be being unselfish to go away and be\nhappy for a little, because we would come back so much nicer. You see,\nafter a bit everybody needs a holiday.”“But—how do you mean, get it?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Take it,” said Mrs. Wilkins.“Take it?”“Rent it. Hire it. Have it.”“But—do you mean you and I?”“Yes. Between us. Share. Then it would only cost half, and you look\nso—you look exactly as if you wanted it just as much as I do—as if you\nought to have a rest—have something happy happen to you.”“Why, but we don’t know each other.”“But just think how well we would if we went away together for a month!\nAnd I’ve saved for a rainy day, and I expect so have you, and this _is_\nthe rainy day—look at it—”“She is unbalanced,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot; yet she felt strangely\nstirred.“Think of getting away for a whole month—from everything—to heaven—”“She shouldn’t say things like that,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot. “The\nvicar—” Yet she felt strangely stirred. It would indeed be wonderful to\nhave a rest, a cessation.Habit, however, steadied her again; and years of intercourse with the\npoor made her say, with the slight though sympathetic superiority of\nthe explainer, “But then, you see, heaven isn’t somewhere else. It is\nhere and now. We are told so.”She became very earnest, just as she did when trying patiently to help\nand enlighten the poor. “Heaven is within us,” she said in her gentle\nlow voice. “We are told that on the very highest authority. And you\nknow the lines about the kindred points, don’t you—”“Oh yes, I know _them_,” interrupted Mrs. Wilkins impatiently.“The kindred points of heaven and home,” continued Mrs. Arbuthnot, who\nwas used to finishing her sentences. “Heaven is in our home.”“It isn’t,” said Mrs. Wilkins, again surprisingly.Mrs. Arbuthnot was taken aback. Then she said gently, “Oh, but it is.\nIt is there if we choose, if we make it.”“I do choose, and I do make it, and it isn’t,” said Mrs. Wilkins."

  "content": "Then Mrs. Arbuthnot was silent, for she too sometimes had doubts about\nhomes. She sat and looked uneasily at Mrs. Wilkins, feeling more and\nmore the urgent need to getting her classified. If she could only\nclassify Mrs. Wilkins, get her safely under her proper heading, she\nfelt that she herself would regain her balance, which did seem very\nstrangely to be slipping all to one side. For neither had she had a\nholiday for years, and the advertisement when she saw it had set her\ndreaming, and Mrs. Wilkins’s excitement about it was infectious, and\nshe had the sensation, as she listened to her impetuous, odd talk and\nwatched her lit-up face, that she was being stirred out of sleep.Clearly Mrs. Wilkins was unbalanced, but Mrs. Arbuthnot had met the\nunbalanced before—indeed she was always meeting them—and they had no\neffect on her own stability at all; whereas this one was making her\nfeel quite wobbly, quite as though to be off and away, away from her\ncompass points of God, Husband, Home and Duty—she didn’t feel as if\nMrs. Wilkins intended Mr. Wilkins to come too—and just for once be\nhappy, would be both good and desirable. Which of course it wasn’t;\nwhich certainly of course it wasn’t. She, also, had a nest-egg,\ninvested gradually in the Post Office Savings Bank, but to suppose that\nshe would ever forget her duty to the extent of drawing it out and\nspending it on herself was surely absurd. Surely she couldn’t, she\nwouldn’t ever do such a thing? Surely she wouldn’t, she couldn’t ever\nforget her poor, forget misery and sickness as completely as that? No\ndoubt a trip to Italy would be extraordinarily delightful, but there\nwere many delightful things one would like to do, and what was strength\ngiven to one for except to help one not to do them?"

She had gone to sleep on\nthese facts years ago, after a period of much misery, her head resting\non them as on a pillow; and she had a great dread of being awakened out\nof so simple and untroublesome a condition. Therefore it was that she\nsearched with earnestness for a heading under which to put Mrs.\nWilkins, and in this way illumine and steady her own mind; and sitting\nthere looking at her uneasily after her last remark, and feeling\nherself becoming more and more unbalanced and infected, she decided\n_pro tem_, as the vicar said at meetings, to put her under the heading\nNerves. It was just possible that she ought to go straight into the\ncategory Hysteria, which was often only the antechamber to Lunacy, but\nMrs. Arbuthnot had learned not to hurry people into their final\ncategories, having on more than one occasion discovered with dismay\nthat she had made a mistake; and how difficult it had been to get them\nout again, and how crushed she had been with the most terrible remorse.Yes. Nerves. Probably she had no regular work for others, thought Mrs.\nArbuthnot; no work that would take her outside herself. Evidently she\nwas rudderless—blown about by gusts, by impulses. Nerves was almost\ncertainly her category, or would be quite soon if no one helped her.\nPoor little thing, thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, her own balance returning\nhand in hand with her compassion, and unable, because of the table,\nto see the length of Mrs. Wilkins’s legs. All she saw was her small,\neager, shy face, and her thin shoulders, and the look of childish\nlonging in her eyes for something that she was sure was going to make\nher happy. No; such things didn’t make people happy, such fleeting\nthings. Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned in her long life with Frederick—he\nwas her husband, and she had married him at twenty and was now\nthirty-three—where alone true joys are to be found. They are to be\nfound, she now knew, only in daily, in hourly, living for others;\nthey are to be found only—hadn’t she over and over again taken her\ndisappointments and discouragements there, and come away comforted?—at\nthe feet of God."

I’ll give you my address”—she searched in her\nhandbag—“and then you won’t forget.” And she found a card and held it\nout.Mrs. Wilkins ignored the card.“It’s so funny,” said Mrs. Wilkins, just as if she had not heard her,\n“but I _see_ us both—you and me—this April in the mediaeval castle.”Mrs. Arbuthnot relapsed into uneasiness. “Do you?” she said, making an\neffort to stay balanced under the visionary gaze of the shining grey\neyes. “Do you?”“Don’t you ever see things in a kind of flash before they happen?”\nasked Mrs. Wilkins.“Never,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.She tried to smile; she tried to smile the sympathetic yet wise\nand tolerant smile with which she was accustomed to listen to the\nnecessarily biassed and incomplete views of the poor. She didn’t\nsucceed. The smile trembled out.“Of course,” she said in a low voice, almost as if she were afraid the\nvicar and the Savings Bank were listening, “it would be most\nbeautiful—most beautiful—”“Even if it were wrong,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “it would only be for a\nmonth.”“That—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot, quite clear as to the reprehensibleness\nof such a point of view; but Mrs. Wilkins stopped her before she could\nfinish.“Anyhow,” said Mrs. Wilkins, stopping her, “I’m sure it’s wrong to go\non being good for too long, till one gets miserable. And I can see\nyou’ve been good for years and years, because you look so unhappy”—Mrs.\nArbuthnot opened her mouth to protest—“and I—I’ve done nothing but\nduties, things for other people, ever since I was a girl, and I don’t\nbelieve anybody loves me a bit—a bit—the b-better—and I long—oh, I\nlong—for something else—something else—”Was she going to cry? Mrs. Arbuthnot became acutely uncomfortable and\nsympathetic. She hoped she wasn’t going to cry. Not there. Not in that\nunfriendly room, with strangers coming and going."

I can’t think, I simply don’t know,\nwhat has come over me.”“It’s the advertisement,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, nodding gravely.“Yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins, dabbing furtively at her eyes, “and us both\nbeing so—”—she blew her nose again a little—“miserable.”Chapter 2Of course Mrs. Arbuthnot was not miserable—how could she be, she asked\nherself, when God was taking care of her?—but she let that pass for the\nmoment unrepudiated, because of her conviction that here was another\nfellow-creature in urgent need of her help; and not just boots and\nblankets and better sanitary arrangements this time, but the more\ndelicate help of comprehension, of finding the exact right words.The exact right words, she presently discovered, after trying various\nones about living for others, and prayer, and the peace to be found in\nplacing oneself unreservedly in God’s hands—to meet all these words\nMrs. Wilkins had other words, incoherent and yet, for the moment at\nleast, till one had had more time, difficult to answer—the exact right\nwords were a suggestion that it would do no harm to answer the\nadvertisement. Non-committal. Mere inquiry. And what disturbed Mrs.\nArbuthnot about this suggestion was that she did not make it solely to\ncomfort Mrs. Wilkins; she made it because of her own strange longing\nfor the mediaeval castle.This was very disturbing. There she was, accustomed to direct, to lead,\nto advise, to support—except Frederick; she long since had learned to\nleave Frederick to God—being led herself, being influenced and thrown\noff her feet, by just an advertisement, by just an incoherent stranger.\nIt was indeed disturbing. She failed to understand her sudden longing\nfor what was, after all, self-indulgence, when for years no such desire\nhad entered her heart."

She\nasked for all particulars, but the only one they really wanted was the\none about the rent. They both felt that it was Mrs. Arbuthnot who ought\nto write the letter and do the business part. Not only was she used to\norganising and being practical, but she also was older, and certainly\ncalmer; and she herself had no doubt too that she was wiser. Neither\nhad Mrs. Wilkins any doubt of this; the very way Mrs. Arbuthnot parted\nher hair suggested a great calm that could only proceed from wisdom.But if she was wiser, older and calmer, Mrs. Arbuthnot’s new friend\nnevertheless seemed to her to be the one who impelled. Incoherent, she\nyet impelled. She appeared to have, apart from her need of help, an\nupsetting kind of character. She had a curious infectiousness. She led\none on. And the way her unsteady mind leaped at conclusions—wrong ones,\nof course; witness the one that she, Mrs. Arbuthnot, was miserable—the\nway she leaped at conclusions was disconcerting.Whatever she was, however, and whatever her unsteadiness, Mrs.\nArbuthnot found herself sharing her excitement and her longing; and\nwhen the letter had been posted in the letter-box in the hall and\nactually was beyond getting back again, both she and Mrs. Wilkins felt\nthe same sense of guilt.“It only shows,” said Mrs. Wilkins in a whisper, as they turned away\nfrom the letter-box, “how immaculately good we’ve been all our lives.\nThe very first time we do anything our husbands don’t know about we\nfeel guilty.”"

When you know me better I think you’ll find that I am. And I’m\nsure you don’t mean really that goodness, if one could attain it, makes\none unhappy.”“Yes, I do,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Our sort of goodness does. We have\nattained it, and we are unhappy. There are miserable sorts of goodness\nand happy sorts—the sort we’ll have at the mediaeval castle, for\ninstance, is the happy sort.”“That is, supposing we go there,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot restrainingly.\nShe felt that Mrs. Wilkins needed holding on to. “After all, we’ve only\nwritten just to ask. Anybody may do that. I think it quite likely we\nshall find the conditions impossible, and even if they were not,\nprobably by to-morrow we shall not want to go.”“I _see_ us there,” was Mrs. Wilkins’s answer to that."

  "content": "All this was very unbalancing. Mrs. Arbuthnot, as she presently\nsplashed through the dripping streets on her way to a meeting she\nwas to speak at, was in an unusually disturbed condition of mind.\nShe had, she hoped, shown herself very calm to Mrs. Wilkins, very\npractical and sober, concealing her own excitement. But she was really\nextraordinarily moved, and she felt happy, and she felt guilty, and\nshe felt afraid, and she had all the feelings, though this she did\nnot know, of a woman who has come away from a secret meeting with\nher lover. That, indeed, was what she looked like when she arrived\nlate on her platform; she, the open-browed, looked almost furtive as\nher eyes fell on the staring wooden faces waiting to hear her try\nand persuade them to contribute to the alleviation of the urgent\nneeds of the Hampstead poor, each one convinced that they needed\ncontributions themselves. She looked as though she were hiding\nsomething discreditable but delightful. Certainly her customary clear\nexpression of candour was not there, and its place was taken by a\nkind of suppressed and frightened pleasedness, which would have led a\nmore worldly-minded audience to the instant conviction of recent and\nprobably impassioned lovemaking.Beauty, beauty, beauty . . . the words kept ringing in her ears as she\nstood on the platform talking of sad things to the sparsely attended\nmeeting. She had never been to Italy. Was that really what her nest-egg\nwas to be spent on after all? Though she couldn’t approve of the way\nMrs. Wilkins was introducing the idea of predestination into her\nimmediate future, just as if she had no choice, just as if to struggle,\nor even to reflect, were useless, it yet influenced her. Mrs. Wilkins’s\neyes had been the eyes of a seer. Some people were like that, Mrs.\nArbuthnot knew; and if Mrs. Wilkins had actually seen her at the\nmediaeval castle it did seem probable that struggling would be a waste\nof time. Still, to spend her nest-egg on self-indulgence— The origin of\nthis egg had been corrupt, but she had at least supposed its end was to\nbe creditable. Was she to deflect it from its intended destination,\nwhich alone had appeared to justify her keeping it, and spend it on\ngiving herself pleasure?Mrs. Arbuthnot spoke on and on, so much practised in the kind of speech\nthat she could have said it all in her sleep, and at the end of the\nmeeting, her eyes dazzled by her secret visions, she hardly noticed\nthat nobody was moved in any way whatever, least of all in the way of\ncontributions.But the vicar noticed. The vicar was disappointed. Usually his good\nfriend and supporter Mrs. Arbuthnot succeeded better than this. And,\nwhat was even more unusual, she appeared, he observed, not even to\nmind.“I can’t imagine,” he said to her as they parted, speaking irritably,\nfor he was irritated both by the audience and by her, “what these\npeople are coming to. _Nothing_ seems to move them.”“Perhaps they need a holiday,” suggested Mrs. Arbuthnot; an\nunsatisfactory, a queer reply, the vicar thought.“In February?” he called after her sarcastically.“Oh no—not till April,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot over her shoulder."

  "content": "“Very odd,” thought the vicar. “Very odd indeed.” And he went home and\nwas not perhaps quite christian to his wife.That night in her prayers Mrs. Arbuthnot asked for guidance. She felt\nshe ought really to ask, straight out and roundly, that the mediaeval\ncastle should already have been taken by some one else and the whole\nthing thus be settled, but her courage failed her. Suppose her prayer\nwere to be answered? No; she couldn’t ask it; she couldn’t risk it. And\nafter all—she almost pointed this out to God—if she spent her present\nnest-egg on a holiday she could quite soon accumulate another.\nFrederick pressed money on her; and it would only mean, while she\nrolled up a second egg, that for a time her contributions to the parish\ncharities would be less. And then it could be the next nest-egg whose\noriginal corruption would be purged away by the use to which it was\nfinally put.For Mrs. Arbuthnot, who had no money of her own, was obliged to live\non the proceeds of Frederick’s activities, and her very nest-egg was\nthe fruit, posthumously ripened, of ancient sin. The way Frederick made\nhis living was one of the standing distresses of her life. He wrote\nimmensely popular memoirs, regularly, every year, of the mistresses of\nkings. There were in history numerous kings who had had mistresses,\nand there were still more numerous mistresses who had had kings; so\nthat he had been able to publish a book of memoirs during each year of\nhis married life, and even so there were great further piles of these\nladies waiting to be dealt with. Mrs. Arbuthnot was helpless. Whether\nshe liked it or not, she was obliged to live on the proceeds. He gave\nher a dreadful sofa once, after the success of his Du Barri memoir,\nwith swollen cushions and soft, receptive lap, and it seemed to her\na miserable thing that there, in her very home, should flaunt this\nre-incarnation of a dead old French sinner."

  "content": "Simply good, convinced that morality is the basis of happiness, the\nfact that she and Frederick should draw their sustenance from guilt,\nhowever much purged by the passage of centuries, was one of the secret\nreasons of her sadness. The more the memoired lady had forgotten\nherself, the more his book about her was read and the more free-handed\nhe was to his wife; and all that he gave her was spent, after adding\nslightly to her nest-egg—for she did hope and believe that some day\npeople would cease to want to read of wickedness, and then Frederick\nwould need supporting—on helping the poor. The parish flourished\nbecause, to take a handful at random, of the ill-behaviour of the\nladies Du Barri, Montespan, Pompadour, Ninon de l’Enclos, and even of\nlearned Maintenon. The poor were the filter through which the money\nwas passed, to come out, Mrs. Arbuthnot hoped, purified. She could do\nno more. She had tried in days gone by to think the situation out, to\ndiscover the exact right course for her to take, but had found it, as\nshe had found Frederick, too difficult, and had left it, as she had\nleft Frederick, to God. Nothing of this money was spent on her house\nor dress; those remained, except for the great soft sofa, austere. It\nwas the poor who profited. Their very boots were stout with sins. But\nhow difficult it had been. Mrs. Arbuthnot, groping for guidance, prayed\nabout it to exhaustion. Ought she perhaps to refuse to touch the money,\nto avoid it as she would have avoided the sins which were its source?\nBut then what about the parish’s boots? She asked the vicar what he\nthought, and, through much delicate language, evasive and cautious, it\ndid finally appear that he was for the boots.At least she had persuaded Frederick, when first he began his terrible\nsuccessful career—he only began it after their marriage; when she\nmarried him he had been a blameless official attached to the library of\nthe British Museum—to publish the memoirs under another name, so that\nshe was not publicly branded. Hampstead read the books with glee, and\nhad no idea that their writer lived in its midst. Frederick was almost\nunknown, even by sight, in Hampstead. He never went to any of its\ngatherings. Whatever it was he did in the way of recreation was done in\nLondon, but he never spoke of what he did or whom he saw; he might have\nbeen perfectly friendless for any mention he ever made of friends to\nhis wife. Only the vicar knew where the money for the parish came from,\nand he regarded it, he told Mrs. Arbuthnot, as a matter of honour not\nto mention it.And at least her little house was not haunted by the loose-lived\nladies, for Frederick did his work away from home. He had two rooms\nnear the British Museum, which was the scene of his exhumations, and\nthere he went every morning, and he came back long after his wife was\nasleep. Sometimes he did not come back at all. Sometimes she did not\nsee him for several days together. Then he would suddenly appear at\nbreakfast, having let himself in with his latchkey the night before,\nvery jovial and good-natured and free-handed and glad if she would\nallow him to give her something—a well-fed man, contented with the\nworld; a jolly, full-blooded, satisfied man. And she was always gentle,\nand anxious that his coffee should be as he liked it."

He didn’t seem to bear\nthe remotest resemblance to the original Frederick. He didn’t seem to\nhave the least need of any of the things he used to say were so\nimportant and beautiful—love, home, complete communion of thoughts,\ncomplete immersion in each other’s interests. After those early painful\nattempts to hold him up to the point from which they had hand in hand\nso splendidly started, attempts in which she herself had got terribly\nhurt and the Frederick she supposed she had married was mangled out of\nrecognition, she hung him up finally by her bedside as the chief\nsubject of her prayers, and left him, except for those, entirely to\nGod. She had loved Frederick too deeply to be able now to do anything\nbut pray for him. He had no idea that he never went out of the house\nwithout her blessing going with him too, hovering, like a little echo\nof finished love, round that once dear head. She didn’t dare think of\nhim as he used to be, as he had seemed to her to be in those marvellous\nfirst days of their love-making, of their marriage. Her child had died;\nshe had nothing, nobody of her own to lavish herself on. The poor\nbecame her children, and God the object of her love. What could be\nhappier than such a life, she sometimes asked herself; but her face,\nand particularly her eyes, continued sad.“Perhaps when we’re old . . . perhaps when we are both quite old . . .”\nshe would think wistfully.Chapter 3The owner of the mediaeval castle was an Englishman, a Mr. Briggs, who\nwas in London at the moment and wrote that it had beds enough for eight\npeople, exclusive of servants, three sitting-rooms, battlements,\ndungeons, and electric light. The rent was £60 for the month, the\nservants’ wages were extra, and he wanted references—he wanted\nassurances that the second half of his rent would be paid, the first\nhalf being paid in advance, and he wanted assurances of respectability\nfrom a solicitor, or a doctor, or a clergyman. He was very polite in\nhis letter, explaining that his desire for references was what was\nusual and should be regarded as a mere formality.Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins had not thought of references, and they\nhad not dreamed a rent could be so high. In their minds had floated\nsums like three guineas a week; or less, seeing that the place was\nsmall and old.Sixty pounds for a single month.It staggered them.Before Mrs. Arbuthnot’s eyes rose up boots: endless vistas, all the\nstout boots that sixty pounds would buy; and besides the rent there\nwould be the servants’ wages, and the food, and the railway journeys\nout and home. While as for references, these did indeed seem a\nstumbling-block; it did seem impossible to give any without making\ntheir plan more public than they had intended."

It would be true as far as it went—Mrs. Wilkins\nasserted that it would be quite true, but Mrs. Arbuthnot thought it\nwouldn’t be quite—and it was the only way, Mrs. Wilkins said, to keep\nMellersh even approximately quiet. To spend any of her money just on\nthe mere getting to Italy would cause him indignation; what he would\nsay if he knew she was renting part of a mediaeval castle on her own\naccount Mrs. Wilkins preferred not to think. It would take him days to\nsay it all; and this although it was her very own money, and not a\npenny of it had ever been his.“But I expect,” she said, “your husband is just the same. I expect all\nhusbands are alike in the long run.”Mrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, because her reason for not wanting\nFrederick to know was the exactly opposite one—Frederick would be only\ntoo pleased for her to go, he would not mind it in the very least;\nindeed, he would hail such a manifestation of self-indulgence and\nworldliness with an amusement that would hurt, and urge her to have a\ngood time and not to hurry home with a crushing detachment. Far better,\nshe thought, to be missed by Mellersh than to be sped by Frederick. To\nbe missed, to be needed, from whatever motive, was, she thought, better\nthan the complete loneliness of not being missed or needed at all.She therefore said nothing, and allowed Mrs. Wilkins to leap at her\nconclusions unchecked. But they did, both of them, for a whole day feel\nthat the only thing to be done was to renounce the mediaeval castle;\nand it was in arriving at this bitter decision that they really\nrealised how acute had been their longing for it.Then Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose mind was trained in the finding of ways out\nof difficulties, found a way out of the reference difficulty; and\nsimultaneously Mrs. Wilkins had a vision revealing to her how to reduce\nthe rent.Mrs. Arbuthnot’s plan was simple, and completely successful. She took\nthe whole of the rent in person to the owner, drawing it out of her\nSavings Bank—again she looked furtive and apologetic, as if the clerk\nmust know the money was wanted for purposes of self-indulgence—and,\ngoing up with the six ten pound notes in her hand-bag to the address\nnear the Brompton Oratory where the owner lived, presented them to him,\nwaiving her right to pay only half. And when he saw her, and her parted\nhair and soft dark eyes and sober apparel, and heard her grave voice,\nhe told her not to bother about writing round for those references."
