After she was gone\nhe supposed that he ought to have asked for those references, if only\nbecause she would think him so unbusiness-like not to, but he could as\nsoon have insisted on references from a saint in a nimbus as from that\ngrave, sweet lady.Rose Arbuthnot.Her letter, making the appointment, lay on the table.Pretty name.That difficulty, then, was overcome. But there still remained the other\none, the really annihilating effect of the expense on the nest-eggs,\nand especially on Mrs. Wilkins’s, which was in size, compared with Mrs.\nArbuthnot’s, as the egg of the plover to that of the duck; and this in\nits turn was overcome by the vision vouchsafed to Mrs. Wilkins,\nrevealing to her the steps to be taken for its overcoming. Having got\nSan Salvatore—the beautiful, the religious name, fascinated them—they\nin their turn would advertise in the Agony Column of _The Times_, and\nwould inquire after two more ladies, of similar desires to their own,\nto join them and share the expenses.At once the strain of the nest-eggs would be reduced from half to a\nquarter. Mrs. Wilkins was prepared to fling her entire egg into the\nadventure, but she realised that if it were to cost even sixpence over\nher ninety pounds her position would be terrible. Imagine going to\nMellersh and saying, “I owe.” It would be awful enough if some day\ncircumstances forced her to say, “I have no nest-egg,” but at least she\nwould be supported in such a case by the knowledge that the egg had\nbeen her own. She therefore, though prepared to fling her last penny\ninto the adventure, was not prepared to fling into it a single farthing\nthat was not demonstrably her own; and she felt that if her share of\nthe rent was reduced to fifteen pounds only, she would have a safe\nmargin for the other expenses. Also they might economise very much on\nfood—gather olives off their own trees and eat them, for instance, and\nperhaps catch fish."

  "content": "Of course, as they pointed out to each other, they could reduce the\nrent to an almost negligible sum by increasing the number of sharers;\nthey could have six more ladies instead of two if they wanted to,\nseeing that there were eight beds. But supposing the eight beds were\ndistributed in couples in four rooms, it would not be altogether what\nthey wanted, to find themselves shut up at night with a stranger.\nBesides, they thought that perhaps having so many would not be quite\nso peaceful. After all, they were going to San Salvatore for peace and\nrest and joy, and six more ladies, especially if they got into one’s\nbedroom, might a little interfere with that.\nspeech first\nHowever, there seemed to be only two ladies in England at that moment\nwho had any wish to join them, for they had only two answers to their\nadvertisement.“Well, we only want two,” said Mrs. Wilkins, quickly recovering, for\nshe had imagined a great rush.“I think a choice would have been a good thing,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“You mean because then we needn’t have had Lady Caroline Dester.”“I didn’t say that,” gently protested Mrs. Arbuthnot.“We needn’t have her,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Just one more person would\nhelp us a great deal with the rent. We’re not obliged to have two.”“But why should we not have her? She seems really quite what we want.”“Yes—she does from her letter,” said Mrs. Wilkins doubtfully.She felt she would be terribly shy of Lady Caroline. Incredible as it\nmay seem, seeing how they get into everything, Mrs. Wilkins had never\ncome across any members of the aristocracy.They interviewed Lady Caroline, and they interviewed the other\napplicant, a Mrs. Fisher.Lady Caroline came to the club in Shaftesbury Avenue, and appeared to\nbe wholly taken up by one great longing, a longing to get away from\neverybody she had ever known. When she saw the club, and Mrs.\nArbuthnot, and Mrs. Wilkins, she was sure that here was exactly what\nshe wanted. She would be in Italy—a place she adored; she would not be\nin hotels—places she loathed; she would not be staying with\nfriends—persons she disliked; and she would be in the company of\nstrangers who would never mention a single person she knew, for the\nsimple reason that they had not, could not have, and would not come\nacross them. She asked a few questions about the fourth woman, and was\nsatisfied with the answers. Mrs. Fisher, of Prince of Wales Terrace. A\nwidow. She too would be unacquainted with any of her friends. Lady\nCaroline did not even know where Prince of Wales Terrace was.“It’s in London,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Is it?” said Lady Caroline.It all seemed most restful.Mrs. Fisher was unable to come to the club because, she explained by\nletter, she could not walk without a stick; therefore Mrs. Arbuthnot\nand Mrs. Wilkins went to her."

  "content": "“But if she can’t come to the club how can she go to Italy?” wondered\nMrs. Wilkins, aloud.“We shall hear that from her own lips,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.From Mrs. Fisher’s lips they merely heard, in reply to delicate\nquestioning, that sitting in trains was not walking about; and they\nknew that already. Except for the stick, however, she appeared to be a\nmost desirable fourth—quiet, educated, elderly. She was much older than\nthey or Lady Caroline—Lady Caroline had informed them she was\ntwenty-eight—but not so old as to have ceased to be active-minded. She\nwas very respectable indeed, and still wore a complete suit of black\nthough her husband had died, she told them, eleven years before. Her\nhouse was full of signed photographs of illustrious Victorian dead, all\nof whom she said she had known when she was little. Her father had been\nan eminent critic, and in his house she had seen practically everybody\nwho was anybody in letters and art. Carlyle had scowled at her; Matthew\nArnold had held her on his knee; Tennyson had sonorously rallied her on\nthe length of her pig-tail. She animatedly showed them the photographs,\nhung everywhere on her walls, pointing out the signatures with her\nstick, and she neither gave any information about her own husband nor\nasked for any about the husbands of her visitors; which was the\ngreatest comfort. Indeed, she seemed to think that they also were\nwidows, for on inquiring who the fourth lady was to be, and being told\nit was a Lady Caroline Dester, she said, “Is she a widow too?” And on\ntheir explaining that she was not, because she had not yet been\nmarried, observed with abstracted amiability, “All in good time.”"

  "content": "But Mrs. Fisher’s very abstractedness—and she seemed to be absorbed\nchiefly in the interesting people she used to know and in their\nmemorial photographs, and quite a good part of the interview was taken\nup by reminiscent anecdote of Carlyle, Meredith, Matthew Arnold,\nTennyson, and a host of others—her very abstractedness was a\nrecommendation. She only asked, she said, to be allowed to sit quiet in\nthe sun and remember. That was all Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins\nasked of their sharers. It was their idea of a perfect sharer that she\nshould sit quiet in the sun and remember, rousing herself on Saturday\nevenings sufficiently to pay her share. Mrs. Fisher was very fond, too,\nshe said, of flowers, and once when she was spending a week-end with\nher father at Box Hill—“Who lived at Box Hill?” interrupted Mrs. Wilkins, who hung on Mrs.\nFisher’s reminiscences, intensely excited by meeting somebody who had\nactually been familiar with all the really and truly and undoubtedly\ngreat—actually seen them, heard them talking, touched them.Mrs. Fisher looked at her over the top of her glasses in some surprise.\nMrs. Wilkins, in her eagerness to tear the heart out quickly of Mrs.\nFisher’s reminiscences, afraid that at any moment Mrs. Arbuthnot would\ntake her away and she wouldn’t have heard half, had already interrupted\nseveral times with questions which appeared ignorant to Mrs. Fisher.“Meredith of course,” said Mrs. Fisher rather shortly. “I remember a\nparticular week-end”—she continued. “My father often took me, but I\nalways remember this week-end particularly—”“Did you know Keats?” eagerly interrupted Mrs. Wilkins.Mrs. Fisher, after a pause, said with sub-acid reserve that she had\nbeen unacquainted with both Keats and Shakespeare.“Oh of course—how ridiculous of me!” cried Mrs. Wilkins, flushing\nscarlet. “It’s because”—she floundered—“it’s because the immortals\nsomehow still seem alive, don’t they—as if they were here, going to\nwalk into the room in another minute—and one forgets they are dead. In\nfact one knows perfectly well that they’re not dead—not nearly so dead\nas you and I even now,” she assured Mrs. Fisher, who observed her over\nthe top of her glasses.“I thought I _saw_ Keats the other day,” Mrs. Wilkins incoherently\nproceeded, driven on by Mrs. Fisher’s look over the top of her glasses.\n“In Hampstead—crossing the road in front of that house—you know—the\nhouse where he lived—”Mrs. Arbuthnot said they must be going.Mrs. Fisher did nothing to prevent them."

She had no\nwish to find herself shut up for four weeks with somebody who saw\nthings. It is true that there were three sitting-rooms, besides the\ngarden and the battlements at San Salvatore, so that there would be\nopportunities of withdrawal from Mrs. Wilkins; but it would be\ndisagreeable to Mrs. Fisher, for instance, if Mrs. Wilkins were\nsuddenly to assert that she saw Mr. Fisher. Mr. Fisher was dead; let\nhim remain so. She had no wish to be told he was walking about the\ngarden. The only reference she really wanted, for she was much too old\nand firmly seated in her place in the world for questionable associates\nto matter to her, was one with regard to Mrs. Wilkins’s health. Was her\nhealth quite normal? Was she an ordinary, everyday, sensible woman?\nMrs. Fisher felt that if she were given even one address she would be\nable to find out what she needed. So she asked for references, and her\nvisitors appeared to be so much taken aback—Mrs. Wilkins, indeed, was\ninstantly sobered—that she added, “It is usual.”Mrs. Wilkins found her speech first. “But,” she said, “aren’t we the\nones who ought to ask for some from you?”And this seemed to Mrs. Arbuthnot too the right attitude. Surely it was\nthey who were taking Mrs. Fisher into their party, and not Mrs. Fisher\nwho was taking them into it?For answer Mrs. Fisher, leaning on her stick, went to the writing-table\nand in a firm hand wrote down three names and offered them to Mrs.\nWilkins, and the names were so respectable, more, they were so\nmomentous, they were so nearly august, that just to read them was\nenough. The President of the Royal Academy, the Archbishop of\nCanterbury, and the Governor of the Bank of England—who would dare\ndisturb such personages in their meditations with inquiries as to\nwhether a female friend of theirs was all she should be?"

  "content": "“They have known me since I was little,” said Mrs. Fisher—everybody\nseemed to have known Mrs. Fisher since or when she was little.“I don’t think references are nice things at all between—between\nordinary decent women,” burst out Mrs. Wilkins, made courageous by\nbeing, as she felt, at bay; for she very well knew that the only\nreference she could give without getting into trouble was Shoolbred,\nand she had little confidence in that, as it would be entirely based on\nMellersh’s fish. “We’re not business people. We needn’t distrust each\nother—”And Mrs. Arbuthnot said, with a dignity that yet was sweet, “I’m afraid\nreferences do bring an atmosphere into our holiday plan that isn’t\nquite what we want, and I don’t think we’ll take yours up or give you\nany ourselves. So that I suppose you won’t wish to join us.”And she held out her hand in good-bye.Then Mrs. Fisher, her gaze diverted to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who inspired\ntrust and liking even in Tube officials, felt that she would be idiotic\nto lose the opportunity of being in Italy in the particular conditions\noffered, and that she and this calm-browed woman between them would\ncertainly be able to curb the other one when she had her attacks. So\nshe said, taking Mrs. Arbuthnot’s offered hand, “Very well. I waive\nreferences.”She waived references.The two as they walked to the station in Kensington High Street could\nnot help thinking that this way of putting it was lofty. Even Mrs.\nArbuthnot, spendthrift of excuses for lapses, thought Mrs. Fisher might\nhave used other words; and Mrs. Wilkins, by the time she got to the\nstation, and the walk and the struggle on the crowded pavement with\nother people’s umbrellas had warmed her blood, actually suggested\nwaiving Mrs. Fisher.“If there is any waiving to be done, do let us be the ones who waive,”\nshe said eagerly.But Mrs. Arbuthnot, as usual, held on to Mrs. Wilkins; and presently,\nhaving cooled down in the train, Mrs. Wilkins announced that at San\nSalvatore Mrs. Fisher would find her level. “I see her finding her\nlevel there,” she said, her eyes very bright."

In this way everything would be got nicely ready\nfor the two who seemed, in spite of the equality of the sharing, yet to\nhave something about them of guests.There were disagreeable incidents towards the end of March, when Mrs.\nWilkins, her heart in her mouth and her face a mixture of guilt, terror\nand determination, told her husband that she had been invited to Italy,\nand he declined to believe it. Of course he declined to believe it.\nNobody had ever invited his wife to Italy before. There was no\nprecedent. He required proofs. The only proof was Mrs. Arbuthnot, and\nMrs. Wilkins had produced her; but after what entreaties, what\npassionate persuading! Mrs. Arbuthnot had not imagined she would have\nto face Mr. Wilkins and say things to him that were short of the truth,\nand it brought home to her what she had for some time suspected, that\nshe was slipping more and more away from God.Indeed, the whole of March was filled with unpleasant, anxious moments.\nIt was an uneasy month. Mrs. Arbuthnot’s conscience, made\nsuper-sensitive by years of pampering, could not reconcile what she was\ndoing with its own high standard of what was right. It gave her little\npeace. It nudged her at her prayers. It punctuated her entreaties for\ndivine guidance with disconcerting questions, such as, “Are you not a\nhypocrite? Do you really mean that? Would you not, frankly, be\ndisappointed if that prayer were granted?”"

They had\nbronchitis; they had fevers; there was no end to the distress. And here\nshe was going off, spending precious money on going off, simply and\nsolely to be happy. One woman. One woman being happy, and these piteous\nmultitudes . . .She was unable to look the vicar in the face. He did not know, nobody\nknew, what she was going to do, and from the very beginning she was\nunable to look anybody in the face. She excused herself from making\nspeeches appealing for money. How could she stand up and ask people for\nmoney when she herself was spending so much on her own selfish\npleasure? Nor did it help her or quiet her that, having actually told\nFrederick, in her desire to make up for what she was squandering, that\nshe would be grateful if he would let her have some money, he instantly\ngave her a cheque for £100. He asked no questions. She was scarlet. He\nlooked at her a moment and then looked away. It was a relief to\nFrederick that she should take some money. She gave it all immediately\nto the organisation she worked with, and found herself more tangled in\ndoubts than ever.Mrs. Wilkins, on the contrary, had no doubts. She was quite certain\nthat it was a most proper thing to have a holiday, and altogether right\nand beautiful to spend one’s own hard-collected savings on being happy.“Think how much nicer we shall be when we come back,” she said to Mrs.\nArbuthnot, encouraging that pale lady.No, Mrs. Wilkins had no doubts, but she had fears; and March was for\nher too an anxious month, with the unconscious Mr. Wilkins coming back\ndaily to his dinner and eating his fish in the silence of imagined\nsecurity."

Mrs. Wilkins, who was very careful all this\nmonth to give Mellersh only the food he liked, buying it and hovering\nover its cooking with a zeal more than common, succeeded so well that\nMellersh was pleased; definitely pleased; so much pleased that he began\nto think that he might, after all, have married the right wife instead\nof, as he had frequently suspected, the wrong one. The result was that\non the third Sunday in the month—Mrs. Wilkins had made up her trembling\nmind that on the fourth Sunday, there being five in that March and\nit being on the fifth of them that she and Mrs. Arbuthnot were to\nstart, she would tell Mellersh of her invitation—on the third Sunday,\nthen, after a very well-cooked lunch in which the Yorkshire pudding\nhad melted in his mouth and the apricot tart had been so perfect that\nhe ate it all, Mellersh, smoking his cigar by the brightly burning\nfire the while hail gusts banged on the window, said: “I am thinking\nof taking you to Italy for Easter.” And paused for her astounded and\ngrateful ecstasy.None came. The silence in the room, except for the hail hitting the\nwindows and the gay roar of the fire, was complete. Mrs. Wilkins could\nnot speak. She was dumbfounded. The next Sunday was the day she had\nmeant to break her news to him, and she had not yet even prepared the\nform of words in which she would break it.Mr. Wilkins, who had not been abroad since before the war, and was\nnoticing with increasing disgust, as week followed week of wind and\nrain, the peculiar persistent vileness of the weather, had slowly\nconceived a desire to get away from England for Easter. He was doing\nvery well in his business. He could afford a trip. Switzerland was\nuseless in April. There was a familiar sound about Easter in Italy. To\nItaly he would go; and as it would cause comment if he did not take his\nwife, take her he must—besides, she would be useful; a second person\nwas always useful in a country whose language one did not speak for\nholding things, for waiting with the luggage.He had expected an explosion of gratitude and excitement. The absence\nof it was incredible. She could not, he concluded, have heard. Probably\nshe was absorbed in some foolish day-dream. It was regrettable how\nchildish she remained.He turned his head—their chairs were in front of the fire—and looked at\nher. She was staring straight into the fire, and it was no doubt the\nfire that made her face so red.“I am thinking,” he repeated, raising his clear, cultivated voice and\nspeaking with acerbity, for inattention at such a moment was\ndeplorable, “of taking you to Italy for Easter. Did you not hear me?”Yes, she had heard him, and she had been wondering at the extraordinary\ncoincidence—really most extraordinary—she was just going to tell him\nhow—how she had been invited—a friend had invited her—Easter,\ntoo—Easter was in April, wasn’t it?—her friend had a—had a house\nthere.In fact Mrs. Wilkins, driven by terror, guilt and surprise, had been\nmore incoherent if possible than usual."

He demanded that she\nrefuse the invitation. He demanded that, since she had so outrageously\naccepted it without consulting him, she should write and cancel her\nacceptance. Finding himself up against an unsuspected, shocking rock of\nobstinacy in her, he then declined to believe she had been invited to\nItaly at all. He declined to believe in this Mrs. Arbuthnot, of whom\ntill that moment he had never heard; and it was only when the gentle\ncreature was brought round—with such difficulty, with such a desire on\nher part to throw the whole thing up rather than tell Mr. Wilkins less\nthan the truth—and herself endorsed his wife’s statements that he was\nable to give them credence. He could not but believe Mrs. Arbuthnot.\nShe produced the precise effect on him that she did on Tube officials.\nShe hardly needed to say anything. But that made no difference to her\nconscience, which knew and would not let her forget that she had given\nhim an incomplete impression. “Do you,” asked her conscience, “see any\nreal difference between an incomplete impression and a completely\nstated lie? God sees none.”The remainder of March was a confused bad dream. Both Mrs. Arbuthnot\nand Mrs. Wilkins were shattered; try as they would not to, both felt\nextraordinarily guilty; and when on the morning of the 30th they did\nfinally get off there was no exhilaration about the departure, no\nholiday feeling at all.“We’ve been too good—_much_ too good,” Mrs. Wilkins kept on murmuring\nas they walked up and down the platform at Victoria, having arrived\nthere an hour before they need have, “and that’s why we feel as though\nwe’re doing wrong. We’re brow-beaten—we’re not any longer real human\nbeings. Real human beings aren’t ever as good as we’ve been. Oh”—she\nclenched her thin hands—“to _think_ that we ought to be so happy now,\nhere on the very station, actually starting, and we’re not, and it’s\nbeing spoilt for us just simply because we’ve spoilt _them!_ What have\nwe done—what have we done, I should like to know,” she inquired of Mrs.\nArbuthnot indignantly, “except for once want to go away by ourselves\nand have a little rest from _them?_”Mrs. Arbuthnot, patiently pacing, did not ask who she meant by _them_,\nbecause she knew. Mrs. Wilkins meant their husbands, persisting in her\nassumption that Frederick was as indignant as Mellersh over the\ndeparture of his wife, whereas Frederick did not even know his wife had\ngone."

Why should she tell him\nbeforehand?

Neither of them had ever been there before. Both gazed out\nof the windows with rapt faces. The hours flew as long as it was\ndaylight, and after that there was the excitement of getting nearer,\ngetting quite near, getting there. At Genoa it had begun to rain—Genoa!\nImagine actually being at Genoa, seeing its name written up in the\nstation just like any other name—at Nervi it was pouring, and when at\nlast towards midnight, for again the train was late, they got to\nMezzago, the rain was coming down in what seemed solid sheets. But it\nwas Italy. Nothing it did could be bad. The very rain was\ndifferent—straight rain, falling properly on to one’s umbrella; not\nthat violently blowing English stuff that got in everywhere. And it did\nleave off; and when it did, behold the earth would be strewn with\nroses.Mr. Briggs, San Salvatore’s owner, had said, “You get out at Mezzago,\nand then you drive.” But he had forgotten what he amply knew, that\ntrains in Italy are sometimes late, and he had imagined his tenants\narriving at Mezzago at eight o’clock and finding a string of flys to\nchoose from.The train was four hours late, and when Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins\nscrambled down the ladder-like high steps of their carriage into the\nblack downpour, their skirts sweeping off great pools of sooty wet\nbecause their hands were full of suit-cases, if it had not been for the\nvigilance of Domenico, the gardener at San Salvatore, they would have\nfound nothing for them to drive in. All ordinary flys had long since\ngone home. Domenico, foreseeing this, had sent his aunt’s fly, driven\nby her son his cousin; and his aunt and her fly lived in Castagneto,\nthe village crouching at the feet of San Salvatore, and therefore,\nhowever late the train was, the fly would not dare come home without\ncontaining that which it had been sent to fetch.Domenico’s cousin’s name was Beppo, and he presently emerged out of the\ndark where Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins stood, uncertain what to do\nnext after the train had gone on, for they could see no porter and they\nthought from the feel of it that they were standing not so much on a\nplatform as in the middle of the permanent way."

However, they presently from out of his\nstreaming talk discerned the words San Salvatore, and after that they\nkept on saying them to him, for it was the only Italian they knew, as\nthey hurried after him, unwilling to lose sight of their suit-cases,\nstumbling across rails and through puddles out to where in the road a\nsmall, high fly stood.Its hood was up, and its horse was in an attitude of thought. They\nclimbed in, and the minute they were in—Mrs. Wilkins, indeed, could\nhardly be called in—the horse awoke with a start from its reverie and\nimmediately began going home rapidly; without Beppo; without the\nsuit-cases.Beppo darted after him, making the night ring with his shouts, and\ncaught the hanging reins just in time. He explained proudly, and as it\nseemed to him with perfect clearness, that the horse always did that,\nbeing a fine animal full of corn and blood, and cared for by him,\nBeppo, as if he were his own son, and the ladies must not be alarmed—he\nhad noticed they were clutching each other; but clear, and loud, and\nprofuse of words though he was, they only looked at him blankly.He went on talking, however, while he piled the suit-cases up round\nthem, sure that sooner or later they must understand him, especially as\nhe was careful to talk very loud and illustrate everything he said with\nthe simplest elucidatory gestures, but they both continued only to look\nat him. They both, he noticed sympathetically, had white faces,\nfatigued faces, and they both had big eyes, fatigued eyes. They were\nbeautiful ladies, he thought, and their eyes, looking at him over the\ntops of the suit-cases watching his every movement—there were no\ntrunks, only numbers of suit-cases—were like the eyes of the Mother of\nGod. The only thing the ladies said, and they repeated it at regular\nintervals, even after they had started, gently prodding him as he sat\non his box to call his attention to it, was, “San Salvatore?”And each time he answered vociferously, encouragingly, “_Sì, sì_—San\nSalvatore.”"

On their right was something close\nand steep and high and black—rocks, they whispered to each other; huge\nrocks.“No—we don’t _know_,” agreed Mrs. Wilkins, a slight coldness passing\ndown her spine.They felt very uncomfortable. It was so late. It was so dark. The road\nwas so lonely. Suppose a wheel came off. Suppose they met Fascisti, or\nthe opposite of Fascisti. How sorry they were now that they had not\nslept at Genoa and come on the next morning in daylight.“But that would have been the first of April,” said Mrs. Wilkins, in a\nlow voice.“It is that now,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot beneath her breath.“So it is,” murmured Mrs. Wilkins.They were silent.Beppo turned round on his box—a disquieting habit already noticed, for\nsurely his horse ought to be carefully watched—and again addressed them\nwith what he was convinced was lucidity—no _patois_, and the clearest\nexplanatory movements.How much they wished their mothers had made them learn Italian when\nthey were little. If only now they could have said, “Please sit round\nthe right way and look after the horse.” They did not even know what\nhorse was in Italian. It was contemptible to be so ignorant."

They wanted him to turn round again and face his\nhorse, that was all. He thought they wanted him to drive faster; and\nthere followed a terrifying ten minutes during which, as he supposed,\nhe was gratifying them. He was proud of his horse, and it could go very\nfast. He rose in his seat, the whip cracked, the horse rushed forward,\nthe rocks leaped towards them, the little fly swayed, the suit-cases\nheaved, Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins clung. In this way they\ncontinued, swaying, heaving, clattering, clinging, till at a point near\nCastagneto there was a rise in the road, and on reaching the foot of\nthe rise the horse, who knew every inch of the way, stopped suddenly,\nthrowing everything in the fly into a heap, and then proceeded up at\nthe slowest of walks.Beppo twisted himself round to receive their admiration, laughing with\npride in his horse.There was no answering laugh from the beautiful ladies. Their eyes,\nfixed on him, seemed bigger than ever, and their faces against the\nblack of the night showed milky.But here at least, once they were up the slope, were houses. The rocks\nleft off, and there were houses; the low wall left off, and there were\nhouses; the sea shrunk away, and the sound of it ceased, and the\nloneliness of the road was finished. No lights anywhere, of course,\nnobody to see them pass; and yet Beppo, when the houses began, after\nlooking over his shoulder and shouting “Castagneto” at the ladies, once\nmore stood up and cracked his whip and once more made his horse dash\nforward.“We shall be there in a minute,” Mrs. Arbuthnot said to herself,\nholding on.“We shall soon stop now,” Mrs. Wilkins said to herself, holding on.\nThey said nothing aloud, because nothing would have been heard above\nthe whip-cracking and the wheel-clattering and the boisterous inciting\nnoises Beppo was making at his horse.Anxiously they strained their eyes for any sight of the beginning of\nSan Salvatore.They had supposed and hoped that after a reasonable amount of village a\nmediaeval archway would loom upon them, and through it they would drive\ninto a garden and draw up at an open, welcoming door, with light\nstreaming from it and those servants standing in it who, according to\nthe advertisement, remained.Instead the fly suddenly stopped.Peering out they could see they were still in the village street, with\nsmall dark houses each side; and Beppo, throwing the reins over the\nhorse’s back as if completely confident this time that he would not go\nany farther, got down off his box. At the same moment, springing as it\nseemed out of nothing, a man and several half-grown boys appeared on\neach side of the fly and began dragging out the suit-cases."

She knew she\ncould do nothing if these men were wicked men determined to have her\nsuit-cases.“I don’t think it can be,” she admitted, and could not refrain from a\nmoment’s wonder at the ways of God. Had she really been brought here,\nshe and poor Mrs. Wilkins, after so much trouble in arranging it, so\nmuch difficulty and worry, along such devious paths of prevarication\nand deceit, only to be—She checked her thoughts, and gently said to Mrs. Wilkins, while the\nragged youths disappeared with the suit-cases into the night and the\nman with the lantern helped Beppo pull the rug off her, that they were\nboth in God’s hands; and for the first time on hearing this, Mrs.\nWilkins was afraid.There was nothing for it but to get out. Useless to try to go on\nsitting in the fly repeating San Salvatore. Every time they said it,\nand their voices each time were fainter, Beppo and the other man merely\nechoed it in a series of loud shouts. If only they had learned Italian\nwhen they were little. If only they could have said, “We wish to be\ndriven to the door.” But they did not even know what door was in\nItalian. Such ignorance was not only contemptible, it was, they now\nsaw, definitely dangerous. Useless, however, to lament it now. Useless\nto put off whatever it was that was going to happen to them by trying\nto go on sitting in the fly. They therefore got out."

The man with the lantern then made signs to them to follow\nhim, talking loud and quickly, and Beppo, they noticed, remained\nbehind. Ought they to pay him? Not, they thought, if they were going to\nbe robbed and perhaps murdered. Surely on such an occasion one did not\npay. Besides, he had not after all brought them to San Salvatore. Where\nthey had got to was evidently somewhere else. Also, he did not show the\nleast wish to be paid; he let them go away into the night with no\nclamour at all. This, they could not help thinking, was a bad sign. He\nasked for nothing because presently he was to get so much.They came to some steps. The road ended abruptly in a church and some\ndescending steps. The man held the lantern low for them to see the\nsteps.“San Salvatore?” said Mrs. Wilkins once again, very faintly, before\ncommitting herself to the steps. It was useless to mention it now, of\ncourse, but she could not go down steps in complete silence. No\nmediaeval castle, she was sure, was ever built at the bottom of steps.Again, however, came the echoing shout—“_Sì, sì_—San Salvatore.”They descended gingerly, holding up their skirts just as if they would\nbe wanting them another time and had not in all probability finished\nwith skirts for ever.The steps ended in a steeply sloping path with flat stone slabs down\nthe middle. They slipped a good deal on these wet slabs, and the man\nwith the lantern, talking loud and quickly, held them up. His way of\nholding them up was polite.“Perhaps,” said Mrs. Wilkins in a low voice to Mrs. Arbuthnot, “It is\nall right after all.”“We’re in God’s hands,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot again; and again Mrs.\nWilkins was afraid.They reached the bottom of the sloping path, and the light of the\nlantern flickered over an open space with houses round three sides. The\nsea was the fourth side, lazily washing backwards and forwards on\npebbles.“San Salvatore,” said the man pointing with his lantern to a black mass\ncurved round the water like an arm flung about it.They strained their eyes. They saw the black mass, and on the top of it\na light.“San Salvatore?” they both repeated incredulously, for where were the\nsuit-cases, and why had they been forced to get out of the fly?“_Sì, sì_—San Salvatore.”"

There was not even a low wall here—nothing to prevent the man\nwith the lantern tipping them in if he wanted to. He did not, however,\ntip them in. Perhaps it was all right after all, Mrs. Wilkins again\nsuggested to Mrs. Arbuthnot on noticing this, who this time was herself\nbeginning to think that it might be, and said no more about God’s\nhands.The flicker of the lantern danced along, reflected in the wet pavement\nof the quay. Out to the left, in the darkness and evidently at the end\nof a jetty, was a red light. They came to an archway with a heavy iron\ngate. The man with the lantern pushed the gate open. This time they\nwent up steps instead of down, and at the top of them was a little path\nthat wound upwards among flowers. They could not see the flowers, but\nthe whole place was evidently full of them.It here dawned on Mrs. Wilkins that perhaps the reason why the fly had\nnot driven them up to the door was that there was no road, only a\nfootpath. That also would explain the disappearance of the suit-cases.\nShe began to feel confident that they would find their suit-cases\nwaiting for them when they got up to the top. San Salvatore was, it\nseemed, on the top of a hill, as a mediaeval castle should be. At a\nturn of the path they saw above them, much nearer now and shining more\nbrightly, the light they had seen from the quay. She told Mrs.\nArbuthnot of her dawning belief, and Mrs. Arbuthnot agreed that it was\nvery likely a true one.Once more, but this time in a tone of real hopefulness, Mrs. Wilkins\nsaid, pointing upwards at the black outline against the only slightly\nless black sky, “San Salvatore?” And once more, but this time\ncomfortingly, encouragingly, came back the assurance, “_Sì, sì_—San\nSalvatore.”They crossed a little bridge, over what was apparently a ravine, and\nthen came a flat bit with long grass at the sides and more flowers.\nThey felt the grass flicking wet against their stockings, and the\ninvisible flowers were everywhere. Then up again through trees, along a\nzigzag path with the smell all the way of the flowers they could not\nsee. The warm rain was bringing out all the sweetness. Higher and\nhigher they went in this sweet darkness, and the red light on the jetty\ndropped farther and farther below them."

Upon\nwhich the man congratulated them in a great flow of polite words, not\none of which they understood, on their magnificent Italian; for this\nwas Domenico, the vigilant and accomplished gardener of San Salvatore,\nthe prop and stay of the establishment, the resourceful, the gifted,\nthe eloquent, the courteous, the intelligent Domenico. Only they did\nnot know that yet; and he did in the dark, and even sometimes in the\nlight, look, with his knife-sharp swarthy features and swift, panther\nmovements, very like somebody wicked.They passed along another flat bit of path, with a black shape like a\nhigh wall towering above them on their right, and then the path went up\nagain under trellises, and trailing sprays of scented things caught at\nthem and shook raindrops on them, and the light of the lantern\nflickered over lilies, and then came a flight of ancient steps worn\nwith centuries, and then another iron gate, and then they were inside,\nthough still climbing a twisting flight of stone steps with old walls\non either side like the walls of dungeons, and with a vaulted roof.At the top was a wrought-iron door, and through it shone a flood of\nelectric light.“_Ecco_,” said Domenico, lithely running up the last few steps ahead\nand pushing the door open.And there they were, arrived; and it was San Salvatore; and their\nsuit-cases were waiting for them; and they had not been murdered.They looked at each other’s white faces and blinking eyes very\nsolemnly.It was a great, a wonderful moment. Here they were, in their mediaeval\ncastle at last. Their feet touched its stones.Mrs. Wilkins put her arm round Mrs. Arbuthnot’s neck and kissed her.“The first thing to happen in this house,” she said softly, solemnly,\n“shall be a kiss.”“Dear Lotty,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Dear Rose,” said Mrs. Wilkins, her eyes brimming with gladness."

What would she see out of her\nwindow? A shining world, or a world of rain? But it would be beautiful;\nwhatever it was would be beautiful.She was in a little bedroom with bare white walls and a stone floor\nand sparse old furniture. The beds—there were two—were made of iron,\nenamelled black and painted with bunches of gay flowers. She lay\nputting off the great moment of going to the window as one puts off\nopening a precious letter, gloating over it. She had no idea what time\nit was; she had forgotten to wind up her watch ever since, centuries\nago, she last went to bed in Hampstead. No sounds were to be heard in\nthe house, so she supposed it was very early, yet she felt as if she\nhad slept a long while—so completely rested, so perfectly content.\nShe lay with her arms clasped round her head thinking how happy she\nwas, her lips curved upwards in a delighted smile. In bed by herself:\nadorable condition. She had not been in a bed without Mellersh once\nnow for five whole years; and the cool roominess of it, the freedom\nof one’s movements, the sense of recklessness, of audacity, in giving\nthe blankets a pull if one wanted to, or twitching the pillows more\ncomfortably!
