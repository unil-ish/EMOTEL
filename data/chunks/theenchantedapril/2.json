  "content": "“Let’s go and look at that tree close,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “I don’t\nbelieve it can only be a tree.”And arm in arm they went along the hall, and their husbands would not\nhave known them their faces were so young with eagerness, and together\nthey stood at the open window, and when their eyes, having feasted on\nthe marvellous pink thing, wandered farther among the beauties of the\ngarden, they saw sitting on the low wall at the east edge of it, gazing\nout over the bay, her feet in lilies, Lady Caroline.They were astonished. They said nothing in their astonishment, but\nstood quite still, arm in arm, staring down at her.She too had on a white frock, and her head was bare. They had had no\nidea that day in London, when her hat was down to her nose and her furs\nwere up to her ears, that she was so pretty. They had merely thought\nher different from the other women in the club, and so had the other\nwomen themselves, and so had all the waitresses, eyeing her sideways\nand eyeing her again as they passed the corner where she sat talking;\nbut they had had no idea she was so pretty. She was exceedingly pretty.\nEverything about her was very much that which it was. Her fair hair was\nvery fair, her lovely grey eyes were very lovely and grey, her dark\neyelashes were very dark, her white skin was very white, her red mouth\nwas very red. She was extravagantly slender—the merest thread of a\ngirl, though not without little curves beneath her thin frock where\nlittle curves should be. She was looking out across the bay, and was\nsharply defined against the background of empty blue. She was full in\nthe sun. Her feet dangled among the leaves and flowers of the lilies\njust as if it did not matter that they should be bent or bruised.“She ought to have a headache,” whispered Mrs. Arbuthnot at last,\n“sitting there in the sun like that.”“She ought to have a hat,” whispered Mrs. Wilkins.“She’s treading on lilies.”“But they’re hers as much as ours.”“Only one-fourth of them.”"

  "content": "Lady Caroline turned her head. She looked up at them a moment,\nsurprised to see them so much younger than they had seemed that day at\nthe club, and so much less unattractive. Indeed, they were really\nalmost quite attractive, if any one could ever be really quite\nattractive in the wrong clothes. Her eyes, swiftly glancing over them,\ntook in every inch of each of them in the half second before she smiled\nand waved her hand and called out Good-morning. There was nothing, she\nsaw at once, to be hoped for in the way of interest from their clothes.\nShe did not consciously think this, for she was having a violent\nreaction against beautiful clothes and the slavery they impose on one,\nher experience being that the instant one had got them they took one in\nhand and gave one no peace till they had been everywhere and been seen\nby everybody. You didn’t take your clothes to parties; they took you.\nIt was quite a mistake to think that a woman, a really well-dressed\nwoman, wore out her clothes; it was the clothes that wore out the\nwoman—dragging her about at all hours of the day and night. No wonder\nmen stayed young longer. Just new trousers couldn’t excite them. She\ncouldn’t suppose that even the newest trousers ever behaved like that,\ntaking the bit between their teeth. Her images were disorderly, but she\nthought as she chose, she used what images she liked. As she got off the\nwall and came towards the window, it seemed a restful thing to know she\nwas going to spend an entire month with people in dresses made as she\ndimly remembered dresses used to be made five summers ago.“I got here yesterday morning,” she said, looking up at them and\nsmiling. She really was bewitching. She had everything, even a dimple.“It’s a great pity,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling back, “because we\nwere going to choose the nicest room for you.”“Oh, but I’ve done that,” said Lady Caroline. “At least, I think it’s\nthe nicest. It looks two ways—I adore a room that looks two ways, don’t\nyou? Over the sea to the west, and over this Judas tree to the north.”“And we had meant to make it pretty for you with flowers,” said Mrs.\nWilkins.“Oh, Domenico did that. I told him to directly I got here. He’s the\ngardener. He’s wonderful.”“It’s a good thing, of course,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot a little\nhesitatingly, “to be independent, and to know exactly what one wants.”“Yes, it saves trouble,” agreed Lady Caroline.“But one shouldn’t be so independent,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “as to leave\nno opportunity for other people to exercise their benevolences on one.”Lady Caroline, who had been looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot, now looked at\nMrs. Wilkins. That day at that queer club she had had merely a blurred\nimpression of Mrs. Wilkins, for it was the other one who did all the\ntalking, and her impression had been of somebody so shy, so awkward\nthat it was best to take no notice of her. She had not even been able\nto say good-bye properly, doing it in an agony, turning red, turning\ndamp. Therefore she now looked at her in some surprise; and she was\nstill more surprised when Mrs. Wilkins added, gazing at her with the\nmost obvious sincere admiration, speaking indeed with a conviction that\nrefused to remain unuttered, “I didn’t realise you were _so_ pretty.”She stared at Mrs. Wilkins. She was not usually told this quite so\nimmediately and roundly. Abundantly as she was used to it—impossible\nnot to be after twenty-eight solid years—it surprised her to be told it\nwith such bluntness, and by a woman.“It’s very kind of you to think so,” she said.“Why, you’re lovely,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Quite, quite lovely.”"

  "content": "“I hope,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot pleasantly, “you make the most of it.”Lady Caroline then stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Oh yes,” she said. “I\nmake the most of it. I’ve been doing that ever since I can remember.”“Because,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smiling and raising a warning\nforefinger, “it won’t last.”Then Lady Caroline began to be afraid these two were originals. If so,\nshe would be bored. Nothing bored her so much as people who insisted\non being original, who came and buttonholed her and kept her waiting\nwhile they were being original. And the one who admired her—it would\nbe tiresome if she dogged her about in order to look at her. What\nshe wanted of this holiday was complete escape from all she had had\nbefore, she wanted the rest of complete contrast. Being admired, being\ndogged, wasn’t contrast, it was repetition; and as for originals, to\nfind herself shut up with two on the top of a precipitous hill in a\nmediaeval castle built for the express purpose of preventing easy\ngoings out and in, would not, she was afraid, be especially restful.\nPerhaps she had better be a little less encouraging. They had seemed\nsuch timid creatures, even the dark one—she couldn’t remember their\nnames—that day at the club, that she had felt it quite safe to be very\nfriendly. Here they had come out of their shells; already; indeed, at\nonce. There was no sign of timidity about either of them here. If they\nhad got out of their shells so immediately, at the very first contact,\nunless she checked them they would soon begin to press upon her, and\nthen good-bye to her dream of thirty restful, silent days, lying\nunmolested in the sun, getting her feathers smooth again, not being\nspoken to, not waited on, not grabbed at and monopolised, but just\nrecovering from the fatigue, the deep and melancholy fatigue, of the\ntoo much."

  "content": "Besides, there was Mrs. Fisher. She too must be checked. Lady Caroline\nhad started two days earlier than had been arranged for two reasons:\nfirst, because she wished to arrive before the others in order to pick\nout the room or rooms she preferred, and second, because she judged it\nlikely that otherwise she would have to travel with Mrs. Fisher. She\ndid not want to travel with Mrs. Fisher. She did not want to arrive\nwith Mrs. Fisher. She saw no reason whatever why for a single moment\nshe should have to have anything at all to do with Mrs. Fisher.But unfortunately Mrs. Fisher also was filled with a desire to get to\nSan Salvatore first and pick out the room or rooms she preferred, and\nshe and Lady Caroline had after all travelled together. As early as\nCalais they began to suspect it; in Paris they feared it; at Modane\nthey knew it; at Mezzago they concealed it, driving out to Castagneto\nin two separate flys, the nose of the one almost touching the back of\nthe other the whole way. But when the road suddenly left off at the\nchurch and the steps, further evasion was impossible; and faced by this\nabrupt and difficult finish to their journey there was nothing for it\nbut to amalgamate.Because of Mrs. Fisher’s stick Lady Caroline had to see about\neverything. Mrs. Fisher’s intentions, she explained from her fly when\nthe situation had become plain to her, were active, but her stick\nprevented their being carried out. The two drivers told Lady Caroline\nboys would have to carry the luggage up to the castle, and she went in\nsearch of some, while Mrs. Fisher waited in the fly because of her\nstick. Mrs. Fisher could speak Italian, but only, she explained, the\nItalian of Dante, which Matthew Arnold used to read with her when she\nwas a girl, and she thought this might be above the heads of boys.\nTherefore Lady Caroline, who spoke ordinary Italian very well, was\nobviously the one to go and do things.“I am in your hands,” said Mrs. Fisher, sitting firmly in her fly. “You\nmust please regard me as merely an old woman with a stick.”And presently, down the steps and cobbles to the piazza, and along the\nquay, and up the zigzag path, Lady Caroline found herself as much\nobliged to walk slowly with Mrs. Fisher as if she were her own\ngrandmother.“It’s my stick,” Mrs. Fisher complacently remarked at intervals."

No eucalyptus tree, of course, but otherwise curiously like this.\nAnd at one of the bends he turned and said to me—I see him now turning\nand saying to me—”Yes, Mrs. Fisher would have to be checked. And so would these two up at\nthe window. She had better begin at once. She was sorry she had got off\nthe wall. All she need have done was to have waved her hand, and waited\ntill they came down and out into the garden to her."

  "content": "So she ignored Mrs. Arbuthnot’s remark and raised forefinger, and said\nwith marked coldness—at least, she tried to make it sound marked—that\nshe supposed they would be going to breakfast, and that she had had\nhers; but it was her fate that however coldly she sent forth her words\nthey came out sounding quite warm and agreeable. That was because she\nhad a sympathetic and delightful voice, due entirely to some special\nformation of her throat and the roof of her mouth, and having nothing\nwhatever to do with what she was feeling. Nobody in consequence ever\nbelieved they were being snubbed. It was most tiresome. And if she\nstared icily it did not look icy at all, because her eyes, lovely to\nbegin with, had the added loveliness of very long, soft, dark\neyelashes. No icy stare could come out of eyes like that; it got caught\nand lost in the soft eyelashes, and the persons stared at merely\nthought they were being regarded with a flattering and exquisite\nattentiveness. And if ever she was out of humour or definitely\ncross—and who would not be sometimes in such a world?—she only looked\nso pathetic that people all rushed to comfort her, if possible by means\nof kissing. It was more than tiresome, it was maddening. Nature was\ndetermined that she should look and sound angelic. She could never be\ndisagreeable or rude without being completely misunderstood.“I had my breakfast in my room,” she said, trying her utmost to sound\ncurt. “Perhaps I’ll see you later.”And she nodded, and went back to where she had been sitting on the\nwall, with the lilies being nice and cool round her feet.Chapter 7Their eyes followed her admiringly. They had no idea they had been\nsnubbed. It was a disappointment, of course, to find she had\nforestalled them and that they were not to have the happiness of\npreparing for her, of watching her face when she arrived and first saw\neverything, but there was still Mrs. Fisher. They would concentrate on\nMrs. Fisher, and would watch her face instead; only, like everybody\nelse, they would have preferred to watch Lady Caroline’s.Perhaps, then, as Lady Caroline had talked of breakfast, they had\nbetter begin by going and having it, for there was too much to be done\nthat day to spend any more time gazing at the scenery—servants to be\ninterviewed, the house to be gone through and examined, and finally\nMrs. Fisher’s room to be got ready and adorned.They waved their hands gaily at Lady Caroline, who seemed absorbed in\nwhat she saw and took no notice, and turning away found the maidservant\nof the night before had come up silently behind them in cloth slippers\nwith string soles.She was Francesca, the elderly parlour-maid, who had been with the\nowner, he had said, for years, and whose presence made inventories\nunnecessary; and after wishing them good-morning and hoping they had\nslept well, she told them breakfast was ready in the dining-room on the\nfloor below, and if they would follow her she would lead."

  "content": "They did not understand a single word of the very many in which\nFrancesca succeeded in clothing this simple information, but they\nfollowed her, for it at least was clear that they were to follow, and\ngoing down the stairs, and along the broad hall like the one above\nexcept for glass doors at the end instead of a window opening into the\ngarden, they were shown into the dining-room; where, sitting at the\nhead of the table having her breakfast, was Mrs. Fisher.This time they exclaimed. Even Mrs. Arbuthnot exclaimed, though her\nexclamation was only “Oh.”Mrs. Wilkins exclaimed at greater length. “Why, but it’s like having\nthe bread taken out of one’s mouth!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins.“How do you do,” said Mrs. Fisher. “I can’t get up because of my\nstick.” And she stretched out her hand across the table.They advanced and shook it.“We had no idea you were here,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Yes,” said Mrs. Fisher, resuming her breakfast. “Yes. I am here.” And\nwith composure she removed the top of her egg.“It’s a great disappointment,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “We had meant to give\nyou _such_ a welcome.”This was the one, Mrs. Fisher remembered, briefly glancing at her, who\nwhen she came to Prince of Wales Terrace said she had seen Keats. She\nmust be careful with this one—curb her from the beginning.She therefore ignored Mrs. Wilkins and said gravely, with a downward\nface of impenetrable calm bent on her egg, “Yes. I arrived yesterday\nwith Lady Caroline.”“It’s really dreadful,” said Mrs. Wilkins, exactly as if she had not\nbeen ignored. “There’s nobody left to get anything ready for now. I\nfeel thwarted. I feel as if the bread had been taken out of my mouth\njust when I was going to be happy swallowing it.”“Where will you sit?” asked Mrs. Fisher of Mrs. Arbuthnot—markedly of\nMrs. Arbuthnot; the comparison with the bread seemed to her most\nunpleasant.“Oh, thank you—” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, sitting down rather suddenly next\nto her.There were only two places she could sit down in, the places laid on\neither side of Mrs. Fisher. She therefore sat down in one, and Mrs.\nWilkins sat down opposite her in the other."

  "content": "Mrs. Fisher was at the head of the table. Round her was grouped the\ncoffee and the tea. Of course they were all sharing San Salvatore\nequally, but it was she herself and Lotty, Mrs. Arbuthnot mildly\nreflected, who had found it, who had had the work of getting it, who\nhad chosen to admit Mrs. Fisher into it. Without them, she could not\nhelp thinking, Mrs. Fisher would not have been there. Morally Mrs.\nFisher was a guest. There was no hostess in this party, but supposing\nthere had been a hostess it would not have been Mrs. Fisher, nor Lady\nCaroline, it would have been either herself or Lotty. Mrs. Arbuthnot\ncould not help feeling this as she sat down, and Mrs. Fisher, the hand\nwhich Ruskin had wrung suspended over the pots before her, inquired,\n“Tea or coffee?” She could not help feeling it even more definitely\nwhen Mrs. Fisher touched a small gong on the table beside her as though\nshe had been used to that gong and that table ever since she was\nlittle, and, on Francesca’s appearing, bade her in the language of\nDante bring more milk. There was a curious air about Mrs. Fisher,\nthought Mrs. Arbuthnot, of being in possession; and if she herself had\nnot been so happy she would have perhaps minded.Mrs. Wilkins noticed it too, but it only made her discursive brain\nthink of cuckoos. She would no doubt immediately have begun to talk of\ncuckoos, incoherently, unrestrainably and deplorably, if she had been\nin the condition of nerves and shyness she was in last time she saw\nMrs. Fisher. But happiness had done away with shyness—she was very\nserene; she could control her conversation; she did not have,\nhorrified, to listen to herself saying things she had no idea of saying\nwhen she began; she was quite at her ease, and completely natural. The\ndisappointment of not going to be able to prepare a welcome for Mrs.\nFisher had evaporated at once, for it was impossible to go on being\ndisappointed in heaven. Nor did she mind her behaving as hostess. What\ndid it matter? You did not mind things in heaven. She and Mrs.\nArbuthnot, therefore, sat down more willingly than they otherwise would\nhave done, one on either side of Mrs. Fisher, and the sun, pouring\nthrough the two windows facing east across the bay, flooded the room,\nand there was an open door leading into the garden, and the garden was\nfull of many lovely things, especially freesias.The delicate and delicious fragrance of the freesias came in through\nthe door and floated round Mrs. Wilkins’s enraptured nostrils. Freesias\nin London were quite beyond her. Occasionally she went into a shop and\nasked what they cost, so as just to have an excuse for lifting up a\nbunch and smelling them, well knowing that it was something awful like\na shilling for about three flowers. Here they were everywhere—bursting\nout of every corner and carpeting the rose beds. Imagine it—having\nfreesias to pick in armsful if you wanted to, and with glorious\nsunshine flooding the room, and in your summer frock, and its being\nonly the first of April!“I suppose you realise, don’t you, that we’ve got to heaven?” she said,\nbeaming at Mrs. Fisher with all the familiarity of a fellow-angel."

  "content": "“They are considerably younger than I had supposed,” thought Mrs.\nFisher, “and not nearly so plain.” And she mused a moment, while she\ntook no notice of Mrs. Wilkins’s exuberance, on their instant and\nagitated refusal that day at Prince of Wales Terrace to have anything\nto do with the giving or the taking of references.Nothing could affect her, of course; nothing that anybody did. She was\nfar too solidly seated in respectability. At her back stood massively\nin a tremendous row those three great names she had offered, and they\nwere not the only ones she could turn to for support and countenance.\nEven if these young women—she had no grounds for believing the one\nout in the garden to be really Lady Caroline Dester, she had merely\nbeen told she was—even if these young women should all turn out to be\nwhat Browning used to call—how well she remembered his amusing and\ndelightful way of putting things—Fly-by-Nights, what could it possibly,\nor in any way matter to her? Let them fly by night if they wished. One\nwas not sixty-five for nothing. In any case there would only be four\nweeks of it, at the end of which she would see no more of them. And in\nthe meanwhile there were plenty of places where she could sit quietly\naway from them and remember. Also there was her own sitting-room, a\ncharming room, all honey-coloured furniture and pictures, with windows\nto the sea towards Genoa, and a door opening on to the battlements. The\nhouse possessed two sitting-rooms, and she had explained to that pretty\ncreature Lady Caroline—certainly a pretty creature, whatever else she\nwas; Tennyson would have enjoyed taking her for blows on the downs—who\nhad seemed inclined to appropriate the honey-coloured one, that she\nneeded some little refuge entirely to herself because of her stick.“Nobody wants to see an old woman hobbling about everywhere,” she had\nsaid. “I shall be quite content to spend much of my time by myself in\nhere or sitting out on these convenient battlements.”"

  "content": "And she had a very nice bedroom, too; it looked two ways, across the\nbay to the morning sun—she liked the morning sun—and onto the garden.\nThere were only two of these bedrooms with cross-views in the house,\nshe and Lady Caroline had discovered, and they were by far the airiest.\nThey each had two beds in them, and she and Lady Caroline had had the\nextra beds taken out at once and put into two of the other rooms. In\nthis way there was much more space and comfort. Lady Caroline, indeed,\nhad turned hers into a bed-sitting-room, with the sofa out of the\nbigger drawing-room and the writing-table and the most comfortable\nchair, but she herself had not had to do that because she had her own\nsitting-room, equipped with what was necessary. Lady Caroline had\nthought at first of taking the bigger sitting-room entirely for her\nown, because the dining-room on the floor below could quite well be\nused between meals to sit in by the two others, and was a very pleasant\nroom with nice chairs, but she had not liked the bigger sitting-room’s\nshape—it was a round room in the tower, with deep slit windows pierced\nthrough the massive walls, and a domed and ribbed ceiling arranged to\nlook like an open umbrella, and it seemed a little dark. Undoubtedly\nLady Caroline had cast covetous glances at the honey-coloured room, and\nif she, Mrs. Fisher, had been less firm would have installed herself in\nit. Which would have been absurd.“I hope,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, smilingly making an attempt to convey to\nMrs. Fisher that though she, Mrs. Fisher, might not be exactly a guest\nshe certainly was not in the very least a hostess, “your room is\ncomfortable.”“Quite,” said Mrs. Fisher. “Will you have some more coffee?”“No, thank you. Will you?”“No, thank you. There were two beds in my bedroom, filling it up\nunnecessarily, and I had one taken out. It has made it much more\nconvenient.”“Oh _that’s_ why I’ve got two beds in my room!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilkins,\nilluminated; the second bed in her little cell had seemed an unnatural\nand inappropriate object from the moment she saw it.“I gave no directions,” said Mrs. Fisher, addressing Mrs. Arbuthnot, “I\nmerely asked Francesca to remove it.”“I have two in my room as well,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Your second one must be Lady Caroline’s. She had hers removed too,”\nsaid Mrs. Fisher. “It seems foolish to have more beds in a room than\nthere are occupiers.”“But _we_ haven’t got any husbands here either,” said Mrs. Wilkins,\n“and I don’t see any use in extra beds in one’s room if one hasn’t got\nhusbands to put in them. Can’t we have them taken away too?”“Beds,” said Mrs. Fisher coldly, “cannot be removed from one room after\nanother. They must remain somewhere.”Mrs. Wilkins’s remarks seemed to Mrs. Fisher persistently unfortunate.\nEach time she opened her mouth she said something best left unsaid.\nLoose talk about husbands had never in Mrs. Fisher’s circle been\nencouraged. In the ’eighties, when she chiefly flourished, husbands\nwere taken seriously, as the only real obstacles to sin. Beds too, if\nthey had to be mentioned, were approached with caution; and a decent\nreserve prevented them and husbands ever being spoken of in the same\nbreath.She turned more markedly than ever to Mrs. Arbuthnot. “Do let me give\nyou a little more coffee,” she said.“No, thank you. But won’t you have some more?”“No indeed. I never have more than two cups at breakfast. Would you\nlike an orange?”"

Have you?”Mrs. Fisher paused before replying. Was this a habit, this trick of\nanswering a simple question with the same question? If so it must be\ncurbed, for no one could live for four weeks in any real comfort with\nsomebody who had a habit.She glanced at Mrs. Arbuthnot, and her parted hair and gentle brow\nreassured her. No; it was accident, not habit, that had produced those\nechoes. She could as soon imagine a dove having tiresome habits as Mrs.\nArbuthnot. Considering her, she thought what a splendid wife she would\nhave been for poor Carlyle. So much better than that horrid clever\nJane. She would have soothed him.“Then shall we go?” she suggested.“Let me help you up,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, all consideration.“Oh, thank you—I can manage perfectly. It’s only sometimes that my\nstick prevents me—”Mrs. Fisher got up quite easily; Mrs. Arbuthnot had hovered over her\nfor nothing.“_I’m_ going to have one of these gorgeous oranges,” said Mrs. Wilkins,\nstaying where she was and reaching across to a black bowl piled with\nthem. “Rose, how can you resist them. Look—have this one. Do have this\nbeauty—” And she held out a big one.“No, I’m going to see to my duties,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, moving\ntowards the door. “You’ll forgive me for leaving you, won’t you,” she\nadded politely to Mrs. Fisher.Mrs. Fisher moved towards the door too; quite easily; almost quickly;\nher stick did not hinder her at all. She had no intention of being left\nwith Mrs. Wilkins.“What time would you like to have lunch?” Mrs. Arbuthnot asked her,\ntrying to keep her head as at least a non-guest, if not precisely a\nhostess, above water.“Lunch,” said Mrs. Fisher, “is at half-past twelve.”“You shall have it at half-past twelve then,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n“I’ll tell the cook.

And even if I\nwere able to go, I fear I shouldn’t be understood.”“But—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot.“But it’s _too_ wonderful,” Mrs. Wilkins finished for her from the\ntable, delighted with these unexpected simplifications in her and\nRose’s lives. “Why, we’ve got positively nothing to do here, either of\nus, except just be happy. You wouldn’t believe,” she said, turning her\nhead and speaking straight to Mrs. Fisher, portions of orange in either\nhand, “how terribly good Rose and I have been for years without\nstopping, and how much now we need a perfect rest.”And Mrs. Fisher, going without answering her out of the room, said to\nherself, “She must, she shall be curbed.”Chapter 8Presently, when Mrs. Wilkins and Mrs. Arbuthnot, unhampered by any\nduties, wandered out and down the worn stone steps and under the\npergola into the lower garden, Mrs. Wilkins said to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who\nseemed pensive, “Don’t you see that if somebody else does the ordering\nit frees us?”Mrs. Arbuthnot said she did see, but nevertheless she thought it rather\nsilly to have everything taken out of their hands.“I love things to be taken out of my hands,” said Mrs. Wilkins.“But we found San Salvatore,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, “and it is rather\nsilly that Mrs. Fisher should behave as if it belonged only to her.”“What is rather silly,” said Mrs. Wilkins with much serenity, “is to\nmind. I can’t see the least point in being in authority at the price of\none’s liberty.”Mrs. Arbuthnot said nothing to that for two reasons—first, because she\nwas struck by the remarkable and growing calm of the hitherto\nincoherent and excited Lotty, and secondly because what she was looking\nat was so very beautiful."

It was\nwistaria. _Wistaria and sunshine_ . . . she remembered the\nadvertisement. Here indeed were both in profusion. The wistaria was\ntumbling over itself in its excess of life, its prodigality of\nflowering; and where the pergola ended the sun blazed on scarlet\ngeraniums, bushes of them, and nasturtiums in great heaps, and\nmarigolds so brilliant that they seemed to be burning, and red and pink\nsnapdragons, all outdoing each other in bright, fierce colour. The\nground behind these flaming things dropped away in terraces to the sea,\neach terrace a little orchard, where among the olives grew vines on\ntrellises, and fig-trees, and peach-trees, and cherry-trees. The\ncherry-trees and peach-trees were in blossom—lovely showers of white\nand deep rose-colour among the trembling delicacy of the olives; the\nfig-leaves were just big enough to smell of figs, the vine-buds were\nonly beginning to show. And beneath these trees were groups of blue and\npurple irises, and bushes of lavender, and grey, sharp cactuses, and\nthe grass was thick with dandelions and daisies, and right down at the\nbottom was the sea. Colour seemed flung down anyhow, anywhere; every\nsort of colour, piled up in heaps, pouring along in rivers—the\nperiwinkles looked exactly as if they were being poured down each side\nof the steps—and flowers that grow only in borders in England, proud\nflowers keeping themselves to themselves over there, such as the great\nblue irises and the lavender, were being jostled by small, shining\ncommon things like dandelions and daisies and the white bells of the\nwild onion, and only seemed the better and the more exuberant for it.They stood looking at this crowd of loveliness, this happy jumble, in\nsilence. No, it didn’t matter what Mrs. Fisher did; not here; not in\nsuch beauty. Mrs. Arbuthnot’s discomposure melted out of her. In the\nwarmth and light of what she was looking at, of what to her was a\nmanifestation, an entirely new side of God, how could one be\ndiscomposed? If only Frederick were with her, seeing it too, seeing as\nhe would have seen it when first they were lovers, in the days when he\nsaw what she saw and loved what she loved. . .She sighed.“You mustn’t sigh in heaven,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “One doesn’t.”“I was thinking how one longs to share this with those one loves,” said\nMrs. Arbuthnot.“You mustn’t long in heaven,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “You’re supposed to be\nquite complete there. And it is heaven, isn’t it, Rose? See how\neverything has been let in together—the dandelions and the irises, the\nvulgar and the superior, me and Mrs. Fisher—all welcome, all mixed up\nanyhow, and all so visibly happy and enjoying ourselves.”“Mrs. Fisher doesn’t seem happy—not visibly, anyhow,” said Mrs.\nArbuthnot, smiling.“She’ll begin soon, you’ll see.”Mrs. Arbuthnot said she didn’t believe that after a certain age people\nbegan anything.Mrs. Wilkins said she was sure no one, however old and tough, could\nresist the effects of perfect beauty. Before many days, perhaps only\nhours, they would see Mrs. Fisher bursting out into every kind of\nexuberance. “I’m quite sure,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “that we’ve got to\nheaven, and once Mrs. Fisher realises that that’s where she is, she’s\nbound to be different. You’ll see. She’ll leave off being ossified, and\ngo all soft and able to stretch, and we shall get quite—why, I\nshouldn’t be surprised if we get quite fond of her.”"

  "content": "The idea of Mrs. Fisher bursting out into anything, she who seemed so\nparticularly firmly fixed inside her buttons, made Mrs. Arbuthnot\nlaugh. She condoned Lotty’s loose way of talking of heaven, because in\nsuch a place, on such a morning, condonation was in the very air.\nBesides, what an excuse there was.And Lady Caroline, sitting where they had left her before breakfast on\nthe wall, peeped over when she heard laughter, and saw them standing on\nthe path below, and thought what a mercy it was they were laughing down\nthere and had not come up and done it round her. She disliked jokes at\nall times, but in the morning she hated them; especially close up;\nespecially crowding in her ears. She hoped the originals were on their\nway out for a walk, and not on their way back from one. They were\nlaughing more and more. What could they possibly find to laugh at?She looked down on the tops of their heads with a very serious face,\nfor the thought of spending a month with laughers was a grave one, and\nthey, as though they felt her eyes, turned suddenly and looked up.The dreadful geniality of those women. . .She shrank away from their smiles and wavings, but she could not shrink\nout of sight without falling into the lilies. She neither smiled nor\nwaved back, and turning her eyes to the more distant mountains surveyed\nthem carefully till the two, tired of waving, moved away along the path\nand turned the corner and disappeared.This time they both did notice that they had been met with, at least,\nunresponsiveness.“If we weren’t in heaven,” said Mrs. Wilkins serenely, “I should say we\nhad been snubbed, but as nobody snubs anybody there of course we can’t\nhave been.”“Perhaps she is unhappy,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Whatever it is she is she’ll get over it here,” said Mrs. Wilkins with\nconviction.“We must try and help her,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.“Oh, but nobody helps anybody in heaven. That’s finished with. You\ndon’t try to be, or do. You simply _are_.”Well, Mrs. Arbuthnot wouldn’t go into that—not here, not to-day. The\nvicar, she knew, would have called Lotty’s talk levity, if not\nprofanity. How old he seemed from here; an old, old vicar."

  "content": "They left the path, and clambered down the olive terraces, down and\ndown, to where at the bottom the warm, sleepy sea heaved gently among\nthe rocks. There a pine-tree grew close to the water, and they sat\nunder it, and a few yards away was a fishing-boat lying motionless and\ngreen-bellied on the water. The ripples of the sea made little gurgling\nnoises at their feet. They screwed up their eyes to be able to look\ninto the blaze of light beyond the shade of their tree. The hot smell\nfrom the pine-needles and from the cushions of wild thyme that padded\nthe spaces between the rocks, and sometimes a smell of pure honey from\na clump of warm irises up behind them in the sun, puffed across their\nfaces. Very soon Mrs. Wilkins took her shoes and stockings off, and let\nher feet hang in the water. After watching her a minute Mrs. Arbuthnot\ndid the same. Their happiness was then complete. Their husbands would\nnot have known them. They left off talking. They ceased to mention\nheaven. They were just cups of acceptance.Meanwhile Lady Caroline, on her wall, was considering her position. The\ngarden on the top of the wall was a delicious garden, but its situation\nmade it insecure and exposed to interruptions. At any moment the others\nmight come and want to use it, because both the hall and the\ndining-room had doors opening straight into it. Perhaps, thought Lady\nCaroline, she could arrange that it should be solely hers. Mrs. Fisher\nhad the battlements, delightful with flowers, and a watch-tower all to\nherself, besides having snatched the one really nice room in the house.\nThere were plenty of places the originals could go to—she had herself\nseen at least two other little gardens, while the hill the castle stood\non was itself a garden, with walks and seats. Why should not this one\nspot be kept exclusively for her? She liked it; she liked it best of\nall. It had the Judas tree and an umbrella pine, it had the freesias\nand the lilies, it had a tamarisk beginning to flush pink, it had the\nconvenient low wall to sit on, it had from each of its three sides the\nmost amazing views—to the east the bay and mountains, to the north the\nvillage across the tranquil clear green water of the little harbour and\nthe hills dotted with white houses and orange groves, and to the west\nwas the thin thread of land by which San Salvatore was tied to the\nmainland, and then the open sea and the coast line beyond Genoa\nreaching away into the blue dimness of France. Yes, she would say she\nwanted to have this entirely to herself. How obviously sensible if each\nof them had their own special place to sit in apart. It was essential\nto her comfort that she should be able to be apart, left alone, not\ntalked to. The others ought to like it best too. Why herd? One had\nenough of that in England, with one’s relations and friends—oh, the\nnumbers of them!—pressing on one continually. Having successfully\nescaped them for four weeks why continue, and with persons having no\nearthly claim on one, to herd?"

How very pleasant this was.Somebody came out through the glass doors, just as she was drawing a\ndeep breath of security. Surely it couldn’t be Mrs. Fisher, wanting to\nsit with her? Mrs. Fisher had her battlements. She ought to stay on\nthem, having snatched them. It would be too tiresome if she wouldn’t,\nand wanted not only to have them and her sitting-room but to establish\nherself in this garden as well.No; it wasn’t Mrs. Fisher, it was the cook.She frowned. Was she going to have to go on ordering the food? Surely\none or other of those two waving women would do that now.The cook, who had been waiting in increasing agitation in the kitchen,\nwatching the clock getting nearer to lunch-time while she still was\nwithout knowledge of what lunch was to consist of, had gone at last to\nMrs. Fisher, who had immediately waved her away. She then wandered\nabout the house seeking a mistress, any mistress, who would tell her\nwhat to cook, and finding none; and at last, directed by Francesca, who\nalways knew where everybody was, came out to Lady Caroline."

  "content": "Domenico had provided this cook. She was Costanza, the sister of that\none of his cousins who kept a restaurant down on the piazza. She helped\nher brother in his cooking when she had no other job, and knew every\nsort of fat, mysterious Italian dish such as the workmen of Castagneto,\nwho crowded the restaurant at midday, and the inhabitants of Mezzago\nwhen they came over on Sundays, loved to eat. She was a fleshless\nspinster of fifty, grey-haired, nimble, rich of speech, and thought\nLady Caroline more beautiful than anyone she had ever seen; and so did\nDomenico; and so did the boy Giuseppe who helped Domenico and was,\nbesides, his nephew; and so did the girl Angela who helped Francesca\nand was, besides, Domenico’s niece; and so did Francesca herself.\nDomenico and Francesca, the only two who had seen them, thought the two\nladies who arrived last very beautiful, but compared to the fair young\nlady who arrived first they were as candles to the electric light that\nhad lately been installed, and as the tin tubs in the bedrooms to the\nwonderful new bathroom their master had had arranged on his last visit.Lady Caroline scowled at the cook. The scowl, as usual, was transformed\non the way into what appeared to be an intent and beautiful gravity,\nand Costanza threw up her hands and took the saints aloud to witness\nthat here was the very picture of the Mother of God.Lady Caroline asked her crossly what she wanted, and Costanza’s head\nwent on one side with delight at the sheer music of her voice. She\nsaid, after waiting a moment in case the music was going to continue,\nfor she didn’t wish to miss any of it, that she wanted orders; she had\nbeen to the Signorina’s mother, but in vain.“She is not my mother,” repudiated Lady Caroline angrily; and her anger\nsounded like the regretful wail of a melodious orphan.Costanza poured forth pity. She too, she explained, had no mother—Lady Caroline interrupted with the curt information that her mother was\nalive and in London.Costanza praised God and the saints that the young lady did not yet\nknow what it was like to be without a mother. Quickly enough did\nmisfortunes overtake one; no doubt the young lady already had a\nhusband.“No,” said Lady Caroline icily. Worse than jokes in the morning did she\nhate the idea of husbands. And everybody was always trying to press\nthem on her—all her relations, all her friends, all the evening papers.\nAfter all, she could only marry one, anyhow; but you would think from\nthe way everybody talked, and especially those persons who wanted to be\nhusbands, that she could marry at least a dozen.Her soft, pathetic “No” made Costanza, who was standing close to her,\nwell with sympathy.“Poor little one,” said Costanza, moved actually to pat her\nencouragingly on the shoulder, “take hope. There is still time.”“For lunch,” said Lady Caroline freezingly, marvelling as she spoke\nthat she should be patted, she who had taken so much trouble to come to\na place, remote and hidden, where she could be sure that among other\nthings of a like oppressive nature pattings also were not, “we will\nhave—”"

  "content": "Costanza became business-like. She interrupted with suggestions, and\nher suggestions were all admirable and all expensive.Lady Caroline did not know they were expensive, and fell in with them\nat once. They sounded very nice. Every sort of young vegetables and\nfruits came into them, and much butter and a great deal of cream and\nincredible numbers of eggs. Costanza said enthusiastically at the end,\nas a tribute to this acquiescence, that of the many ladies and\ngentlemen she had worked for on temporary jobs such as this she\npreferred the English ladies and gentlemen. She more than preferred\nthem—they roused devotion in her. For they knew what to order; they did\nnot skimp; they refrained from grinding down the faces of the poor.From this Lady Caroline concluded that she had been extravagant, and\npromptly countermanded the cream.Costanza’s face fell, for she had a cousin who had a cow, and the cream\nwas to have come from them both.“And perhaps we had better not have chickens,” said Lady Caroline.Costanza’s face fell more, for her brother at the restaurant kept\nchickens in his back-yard, and many of them were ready for killing.“Also do not order strawberries till I have consulted with the other\nladies,” said Lady Caroline, remembering that it was only the first of\nApril, and that perhaps people who lived in Hampstead might be poor;\nindeed, must be poor, or why live in Hampstead? “It is not I who am\nmistress here.”“Is it the old one?” asked Costanza, her face very long.“No,” said Lady Caroline.“Which of the other two ladies is it?”“Neither,” said Lady Caroline.Then Costanza’s smiles returned, for the young lady was having fun with\nher and making jokes. She told her so, in her friendly Italian way, and\nwas genuinely delighted.“I never make jokes,” said Lady Caroline briefly. “You had better go,\nor lunch will certainly not be ready by half-past twelve.”And these curt words came out sounding so sweet that Costanza felt as\nif kind compliments were being paid her, and forgot her disappointment\nabout the cream and the chickens, and went away all gratitude and\nsmiles."

  "content": "“This,” thought Lady Caroline, “will never do. I haven’t come here to\nhousekeep, and I won’t.”She called Costanza back. Costanza came running. The sound of her name\nin that voice enchanted her.“I have ordered the lunch for to-day,” said Lady Caroline, with the\nserious angel face that was hers when she was annoyed, “and I have also\nordered the dinner, but from now on you will go to one of the other\nladies for orders. I give no more.”The idea that she would go on giving orders was too absurd. She never\ngave orders at home. Nobody there dreamed of asking her to do anything.\nThat such a very tiresome activity should be thrust upon her here,\nsimply because she happened to be able to talk Italian, was ridiculous.\nLet the originals give orders if Mrs. Fisher refused to. Mrs. Fisher,\nof course, was the one Nature intended for such a purpose. She had the\nvery air of a competent housekeeper. Her clothes were the clothes of a\nhousekeeper, and so was the way she did her hair.Having delivered herself of her ultimatum with an acerbity that turned\nsweet on the way, and accompanied it by a peremptory gesture of\ndismissal that had the grace and loving-kindness of a benediction, it\nwas annoying that Costanza should only stand still with her head on one\nside gazing at her in obvious delight.“Oh, _go_ away!” exclaimed Lady Caroline in English, suddenly\nexasperated."

It was determined to settle on her\nface, and she was determined it should not. Its persistence was\nuncanny. It woke her, and would not let her go to sleep again. She hit\nat it, and it eluded her without fuss or effort and with an almost\nvisible blandness, and she had only hit herself. It came back again\ninstantly, and with a loud buzz alighted on her cheek. She hit at it\nagain and hurt herself, while it skimmed gracefully away. She lost her\ntemper, and sat up in bed and waited, watching to hit at it and kill\nit. She kept on hitting at it at last with fury and with all her\nstrength, as if it were a real enemy deliberately trying to madden her;\nand it elegantly skimmed in and out of her blows, not even angry, to be\nback again the next instant. It succeeded every time in getting on to\nher face, and was quite indifferent how often it was driven away. That\nwas why she had dressed and come out so early. Francesca had already\nbeen told to put a net over her bed, for she was not going to allow\nherself to be annoyed twice like that. People were exactly like flies.\nShe wished there were nets for keeping them off too. She hit at them\nwith words and frowns, and like the fly they slipped between her blows\nand were untouched. Worse than the fly, they seemed unaware that she\nhad even tried to hit them. The fly at least did for a moment go away.\nWith human beings the only way to get rid of them was to go away\nherself. That was what, so tired, she had done this April; and having\ngot here, having got close up to the details of life at San Salvatore,\nit appeared that here, too, she was not to be let alone.Viewed from London there had seemed to be no details. San Salvatore\nfrom there seemed to be an empty, a delicious blank. Yet, after only\ntwenty-four hours of it, she was discovering that it was not a blank at\nall, and that she was having to ward off as actively as ever. Already\nshe had been much stuck to. Mrs. Fisher had stuck nearly the whole of\nthe day before, and this morning there had been no peace, not ten\nminutes uninterruptedly alone.Costanza of course had finally to go because she had to cook, but\nhardly had she gone before Domenico came. He came to water and tie up.\nThat was natural, since he was the gardener, but he watered and tied up\nall the things that were nearest to her; he hovered closer and closer;\nhe watered to excess; he tied plants that were as straight and steady\nas arrows. Well, at least he was a man, and therefore not quite so\nannoying, and his smiling good-morning was received with an answering\nsmile; upon which Domenico forgot his family, his wife, his mother, his\ngrown-up children and all his duties, and only wanted to kiss the young\nlady’s feet.He could not do that, unfortunately, but he could talk while he worked,\nand talk he did; voluminously; pouring out every kind of information,\nillustrating what he said with gestures so lively that he had to put\ndown the watering-pot, and thus delay the end of the watering.Lady Caroline bore it for a time but presently was unable to bear it,\nand as he would not go, and she could not tell him to, seeing that he\nwas engaged in his proper work, once again it was she who had to."
