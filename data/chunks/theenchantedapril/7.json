I’d immensely like being shown round by you.”“But Mrs. Fisher is waiting for you.”“Won’t she keep?”“Yes,” said Rose, with the smile that had so much attracted him the\nfirst day. “I think she will keep quite well till tea.”“Do you speak Italian?”“No,” said Rose. “Why?”On that he turned to Francesca, and told her at a great rate, for in\nItalian he was glib, to go back to the Signora in the top garden and\ntell her he had encountered his old friend the Signora Arbuthnot, and\nwas going for a walk with her and would present himself to her later.“Do you invite me to tea?” he asked Rose, when Francesca had gone.“Of course. It’s your house.”“It isn’t. It’s yours.”“Till Monday week,” she smiled.“Come and show me all the views,” he said eagerly; and it was plain,\neven to the self-depreciatory Rose, that she did not bore Mr. Briggs.Chapter 18They had a very pleasant walk, with a great deal of sitting down in\nwarm, thyme-fragrant corners, and if anything could have helped Rose to\nrecover from the bitter disappointment of the morning it would have\nbeen the company and conversation of Mr. Briggs. He did help her to\nrecover, and the same process took place as that which Lotty had\nundergone with her husband, and the more Mr. Briggs thought Rose\ncharming the more charming she became.Briggs was a man incapable of concealments, who never lost time if he\ncould help it. They had not got to the end of the headland where the\nlighthouse is—Briggs asked her to show him the lighthouse, because the\npath to it, he knew, was wide enough for two to walk abreast and fairly\nlevel—before he had told her of the impression she had made on him in\nLondon."

  "content": "Since even the most religious, sober women like to know they have made\nan impression, particularly the kind that has nothing to do with\ncharacter or merits, Rose was pleased. Being pleased, she smiled.\nSmiling, she was more attractive than ever. Colour came into her\ncheeks, and brightness into her eyes. She heard herself saying things\nthat really sounded quite interesting and even amusing. If Frederick\nwere listening now, she thought, perhaps he would see that she couldn’t\nafter all be such a hopeless bore; for here was a man, nice-looking,\nyoung, and surely clever—he seemed clever, and she hoped he was, for\nthen the compliment would be still greater—who was evidently quite\nhappy to spend the afternoon just talking to her.And indeed Mr. Briggs seemed very much interested. He wanted to hear\nall about everything she had been doing from the moment she got there.\nHe asked her if she had seen this, that, and the other in the house,\nwhat she liked best, which room she had, if she were comfortable, if\nFrancesca was behaving, if Domenico took care of her, and whether she\ndidn’t enjoy using the yellow sitting-room—the one that got all the sun\nand looked out towards Genoa.Rose was ashamed how little she had noticed in the house, and how few\nof the things he spoke of as curious or beautiful in it she had even\nseen. Swamped in thoughts of Frederick, she appeared to have lived in\nSan Salvatore blindly, and more than half the time had gone, and what\nhad been the good of it? She might just as well have been sitting\nhankering on Hampstead Heath. No, she mightn’t; through all her\nhankerings she had been conscious that she was at least in the very\nheart of beauty; and indeed it was this beauty, this longing to share\nit, that had first started her off hankering.Mr. Briggs, however, was too much alive for her to be able to spare any\nattention at this moment for Frederick, and she praised the servants in\nanswer to his questions, and praised the yellow sitting-room without\ntelling him she had only been in it once and then was ignominiously\nejected, and she told him she knew hardly anything about art and\ncuriosities, but thought perhaps if somebody would tell her about them\nshe would know more, and she said she had spent every day since her\narrival out-of-doors, because out-of-doors there was so very wonderful\nand different from anything she had ever seen."

  "content": "Briggs walked by her side along his paths that were yet so happily for\nthe moment her paths, and felt all the innocent glows of family life.\nHe was an orphan and an only child, and had a warm, domestic\ndisposition. He would have adored a sister and spoilt a mother, and was\nbeginning at this time to think of marrying; for though he had been\nvery happy with his various loves, each of whom, contrary to the usual\nexperience, turned ultimately into his devoted friend, he was fond of\nchildren and thought he had perhaps now got to the age of settling if\nhe did not wish to be too old by the time his eldest son was twenty.\nSan Salvatore had latterly seemed a little forlorn. He fancied it\nechoed when he walked about it. He had felt lonely there; so lonely\nthat he had preferred this year to miss out a spring and let it. It\nwanted a wife in it. It wanted that final touch of warmth and beauty,\nfor he never thought of his wife except in terms of warmth and\nbeauty—she would of course be beautiful and kind. It amused him how\nmuch in love with this vague wife he was already.At such a rate was he making friends with the lady with the sweet name\nas he walked along the path towards the lighthouse, that he was sure\npresently he would be telling her everything about himself and his past\ndoings and his future hopes; and the thought of such a swiftly\ndeveloping confidence made him laugh.“Why are you laughing?” she asked, looking at him and smiling.“It’s so like coming home,” he said.“But it is coming home for you to come here.”“I mean _really_ like coming home. To one’s—one’s family. I never had a\nfamily. I’m an orphan.”“Oh, are you?” said Rose with the proper sympathy. “I hope you’ve not\nbeen one very long. No—I mean I hope you have been one very long. No—I\ndon’t know what I mean, except that I’m sorry.”He laughed again. “Oh I’m used to it. I haven’t anybody. No sisters or\nbrothers.”“Then you’re an only child,” she observed intelligently.“Yes. And there’s something about you that’s exactly my idea of a—of a\nfamily.”She was amused.“So—cosy,” he said, looking at her and searching for a word.“You wouldn’t think so if you saw my house in Hampstead,” she said, a\nvision of that austere and hard-seated dwelling presenting itself to\nher mind, with nothing soft in it except the shunned and neglected Du\nBarri sofa. No wonder, she thought, for a moment clear-brained, that\nFrederick avoided it. There was nothing cosy about _his_ family.“I don’t believe any place you lived in could be anything but exactly\nlike you,” he said.“You’re not going to pretend San Salvatore is like me?”“Indeed I do pretend it. Surely you admit that it is beautiful?”He said several things like that. She enjoyed her walk. She could not\nrecollect any walk so pleasant since her courting days."

  "content": "She came back to tea, bringing Mr. Briggs, and looking quite different,\nMr. Wilkins noticed, from what she had looked till then. Trouble here,\ntrouble here, thought Mr. Wilkins, mentally rubbing his professional\nhands. He could see himself being called in presently to advise. On the\none hand there was Arbuthnot, on the other hand here was Briggs.\nTrouble brewing, trouble sooner or later. But why had Briggs’s telegram\nacted on the lady like a blow? If she had turned pale from excess of\njoy, then trouble was nearer than he had supposed. She was not pale\nnow; she was more like her name than he had yet seen her. Well, he was\nthe man for trouble. He regretted, of course, that people should get\ninto it, but being in he was their man.And Mr. Wilkins, invigorated by these thoughts, his career being very\nprecious to him, proceeded to assist in doing the honours to Mr.\nBriggs, both in his quality of sharer in the temporary ownership of San\nSalvatore and of probable helper out of difficulties, with great\nhospitality, and pointed out the various features of the place to him,\nand led him to the parapet and showed him Mezzago across the bay.Mrs. Fisher too was gracious. This was this young man’s house. He was a\nman of property. She liked property, and she liked men of property.\nAlso there seemed a peculiar merit in being a man of property so young.\nInheritance, of course; and inheritance was more respectable than\nacquisition. It did indicate fathers; and in an age where most people\nappeared neither to have them nor to want them she liked this too.Accordingly it was a pleasant meal, with everybody amiable and pleased.\nBriggs thought Mrs. Fisher a dear old lady, and showed he thought so;\nand again the magic worked, and she became a dear old lady. She\ndeveloped benignity with him, and a kind of benignity which was almost\nplayful—actually before tea was over including in some observation she\nmade him the words “My dear boy.”"

  "content": "Strange words in Mrs. Fisher’s mouth. It is doubtful whether in her\nlife she had used them before. Rose was astonished. How nice people\nreally were. When would she leave off making mistakes about them? She\nhadn’t suspected this side of Mrs. Fisher, and she began to wonder\nwhether those other sides of her with which alone she was acquainted\nhad not perhaps after all been the effect of her own militant and\nirritating behaviour. Probably they were. How horrid, then, she must\nhave been. She felt very penitent when she saw Mrs. Fisher beneath her\neyes blossoming out into real amiability the moment some one came along\nwho was charming to her, and she could have sunk into the ground with\nshame when Mrs. Fisher presently laughed, and she realised by the shock\nit gave her that the sound was entirely new. Not once before had she or\nany one else there heard Mrs. Fisher laugh. What an indictment of the\nlot of them! For they had all laughed, the others, some more and some\nless, at one time or another since their arrival, and only Mrs. Fisher\nhad not. Clearly, since she could enjoy herself as she was now enjoying\nherself, she had not enjoyed herself before. Nobody had cared whether\nshe did or not, except perhaps Lotty. Yes; Lotty had cared, and had\nwanted her to be happy; but Lotty seemed to produce a bad effect on\nMrs. Fisher, while as for Rose herself she had never been with her for\nfive minutes without wanting, really wanting, to provoke and oppose\nher.How very horrid she had been. She had behaved unpardonably. Her\npenitence showed itself in a shy and deferential solicitude towards\nMrs. Fisher which made the observant Briggs think her still more\nangelic, and wish for a moment that he were an old lady himself in\norder to be behaved to by Rose Arbuthnot just like that. There was\nevidently no end, he thought, to the things she could do sweetly. He\nwould even not mind taking medicine, really nasty medicine, if it were\nRose Arbuthnot bending over him with the dose.She felt his bright blue eyes, the brighter because he was so sunburnt,\nfixed on her with a twinkle in them, and smiling asked him what he was\nthinking about.But he couldn’t very well tell her that, he said; and added, “Some\nday.”“Trouble, trouble,” thought Mr. Wilkins at this, again mentally rubbing\nhis hands. “Well, I’m their man.”“I’m sure,” said Mrs. Fisher benignly, “you have no thoughts we may not\nhear.”“I’m sure,” said Briggs, “I would be telling you every one of my\nsecrets in a week.”“You would be telling somebody very safe, then,” said Mrs. Fisher\nbenevolently—just such a son would she have liked to have had. “And in\nreturn,” she went on, “I daresay I would tell you mine.”“Ah no,” said Mr. Wilkins, adapting himself to this tone of easy\n_badinage_, “I must protest. I really must. I have a prior claim, I am\nthe older friend. I have known Mrs. Fisher ten days, and you, Briggs,\nhave not yet known her one. I assert my right to be told her secrets\nfirst. That is,” he added, bowing gallantly, “if she has any—which I\nbeg leave to doubt.”“Oh, haven’t I!” exclaimed Mrs. Fisher, thinking of those green leaves.\nThat she should exclaim at all was surprising, but that she should do\nit with gaiety was miraculous. Rose could only watch her in wonder.“Then I shall worm them out,” said Briggs with equal gaiety.“They won’t need much worming out,” said Mrs. Fisher. “My difficulty is\nto keep them from bursting out.”"

  "content": "It might have been Lotty talking. Mr. Wilkins adjusted the single\neyeglass he carried with him for occasions like this, and examined Mrs.\nFisher carefully. Rose looked on, unable not to smile too since Mrs.\nFisher seemed so much amused, though Rose did not quite know why, and\nher smile was a little uncertain, for Mrs. Fisher amused was a new\nsight, not without its awe-inspiring aspects, and had to be got\naccustomed to.What Mrs. Fisher was thinking was how much surprised they would be if\nshe told them of her very odd and exciting sensation of going to come\nout all over buds. They would think she was an extremely silly old\nwoman, and so would she have thought as lately as two days ago; but the\nbud idea was becoming familiar to her, she was more _apprivoisée_ now,\nas dear Matthew Arnold used to say, and though it would undoubtedly be\nbest if one’s appearance and sensations matched, yet supposing they did\nnot—and one couldn’t have everything—was it not better to feel young\nsomewhere rather than old everywhere? Time enough to be old everywhere\nagain, inside as well as out, when she got back to her sarcophagus in\nPrince of Wales Terrace.Yet it is probable that without the arrival of Briggs Mrs. Fisher would\nhave gone on secretly fermenting in her shell. The others only knew her\nas severe. It would have been more than her dignity could bear suddenly\nto relax—especially towards the three young women. But now came the\nstranger Briggs, a stranger who at once took to her as no young man had\ntaken to her in her life, and it was the coming of Briggs and his real\nand manifest appreciation—for just such a grandmother, thought Briggs,\nhungry for home life and its concomitants, would he have liked to\nhave—that released Mrs. Fisher from her shell; and here she was at\nlast, as Lotty had predicted, pleased, good-humoured and benevolent.Lotty, coming back half an hour later from her picnic, and following\nthe sound of voices into the top garden in the hope of still finding\ntea, saw at once what had happened, for Mrs. Fisher at that very moment\nwas laughing.“She’s burst her cocoon,” thought Lotty; and swift as she was in all\nher movements, and impulsive, and also without any sense of propriety\nto worry and delay her, she bent over the back of Mrs. Fisher’s chair\nand kissed her."

  "content": "“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Fisher, starting violently, for such a\nthing had not happened to her since Mr. Fisher’s earlier days, and then\nonly gingerly. This kiss was a real kiss, and rested on Mrs. Fisher’s\ncheek a moment with a strange, soft sweetness.When she saw whose it was, a deep flush spread over her face. Mrs.\nWilkins kissing her and the kiss feeling so affectionate. . . Even if\nshe had wanted to she could not in the presence of the appreciative Mr.\nBriggs resume her cast-off severity and begin rebuking again; but she\ndid not want to. Was it possible Mrs. Wilkins liked her—had liked her\nall this time, while she had been so much disliking her herself? A\nqueer little trickle of warmth filtered through the frozen defences of\nMrs. Fisher’s heart. Somebody young kissing her—somebody young\n_wanting_ to kiss her. . . Very much flushed, she watched the strange\ncreature, apparently quite unconscious she had done anything\nextraordinary, shaking hands with Mr. Briggs, on her husband’s\nintroducing him, and immediately embarking on the friendliest\nconversation with him, exactly as if she had known him all her life.\nWhat a strange creature; what a very strange creature. It was natural,\nshe being so strange, that one should have, perhaps, misjudged her. . .“I’m sure you want some tea,” said Briggs with eager hospitality to\nLotty. He thought her delightful,—freckles, picnic-untidiness and all.\nJust such a sister would he—“This is cold,” he said, feeling the teapot. “I’ll tell Francesca to\nmake you some fresh—”He broke off and blushed. “Aren’t I forgetting myself,” he said,\nlaughing and looking round at them.“Very natural, very natural,” Mr. Wilkins reassured him.“I’ll go and tell Francesca,” said Rose, getting up.“No, no,” said Briggs. “Don’t go away.” And he put his hands to his\nmouth and shouted.“Francesca!” shouted Briggs.She came running. No summons in their experience had been answered by\nher with such celerity.“‘Her Master’s voice,’” remarked Mr. Wilkins; aptly, he considered.“Make fresh tea,” ordered Briggs in Italian. “Quick—quick—” And then\nremembering himself he blushed again, and begged everybody’s pardon.“Very natural, very natural,” Mr. Wilkins reassured him."

  "content": "Briggs then explained to Lotty what he had explained twice already,\nonce to Rose and once to the other two, that he was on his way to Rome\nand thought he would get out at Mezzago and just look in to see if they\nwere comfortable and continue his journey the next day, staying the\nnight in an hotel at Mezzago.“But how ridiculous,” said Lotty. “Of course you must stay here. It’s\nyour house. There’s Kate Lumley’s room,” she added, turning to Mrs.\nFisher. “You wouldn’t mind Mr. Briggs having it for one night? Kate\nLumley isn’t in it, you know,” she said turning to Briggs again and\nlaughing.And Mrs. Fisher to her immense surprise laughed too. She knew that\nat any other time this remark would have struck her as excessively\nunseemly, and yet now she only thought it funny.No indeed, she assured Briggs, Kate Lumley was not in that room. Very\nfortunately, for she was an excessively wide person and the room was\nexcessively narrow. Kate Lumley might get into it, but that was about\nall. Once in, she would fit it so tightly that probably she would never\nbe able to get out again. It was entirely at Mr. Briggs’s disposal, and\nshe hoped he would do nothing so absurd as go to an hotel—he, the owner\nof the whole place.Rose listened to this speech wide-eyed with amazement. Mrs. Fisher\nlaughed very much as she made it. Lotty laughed very much too, and at\nthe end of it bent down and kissed her again—kissed her several times.“So you see, my dear boy,” said Mrs. Fisher, “you must stay here and\ngive us all a great deal of pleasure.”“A great deal indeed,” corroborated Mr. Wilkins heartily.“A very great deal,” repeated Mrs. Fisher, looking exactly like a\npleased mother.“Do,” said Rose, on Briggs’s turning inquiringly to her.“How kind of you all,” he said, his face broad with smiles. “I’d love\nto be a guest here. What a new sensation. And with three such—”He broke off and looked round. “I say,” he asked, “oughtn’t I to have a\nfourth hostess? Francesca said she had four mistresses.”“Yes. There’s Lady Caroline,” said Lotty.“Then hadn’t we better find out first if she invites me too?”“Oh, but she’s sure—” began Lotty.“The daughter of the Droitwiches, Briggs,” said Mr. Wilkins, “is not\nlikely to be wanting in the proper hospitable impulses.”"

  "content": "“The daughter of the—” repeated Briggs; but he stopped dead, for there\nin the doorway was the daughter of the Droitwiches herself; or rather,\ncoming towards him out of the dark doorway into the brightness of the\nsunset, was that which he had not in his life yet seen but only dreamed\nof, his ideal of absolute loveliness.Chapter 19And then when she spoke . . . what chance was there for poor Briggs? He\nwas undone. All Scrap said was, “How do you do,” on Mr. Wilkins\npresenting him, but it was enough; it undid Briggs.From a cheerful, chatty, happy young man, overflowing with life and\nfriendliness, he became silent, solemn, and with little beads on his\ntemples. Also he became clumsy, dropping the teaspoon as he handed her\nher cup, mismanaging the macaroons, so that one rolled on the ground.\nHis eyes could not keep off the enchanting face for a moment; and when\nMr. Wilkins, elucidating him, for he failed to elucidate himself,\ninformed Lady Caroline that in Mr. Briggs she beheld the owner of San\nSalvatore, who was on his way to Rome, but had got out at Mezzago, etc.\netc., and that the other three ladies had invited him to spend the\nnight in what was to all intents and purposes his own house rather than\nan hotel, and Mr. Briggs was only waiting for the seal of her approval\nto this invitation, she being the fourth hostess—when Mr. Wilkins,\nbalancing his sentences and being admirably clear and enjoying the\nsound of his own cultured voice, explained the position in this manner\nto Lady Caroline, Briggs sat and said never a word.A deep melancholy invaded Scrap. The symptoms of the incipient grabber\nwere all there and only too familiar, and she knew that if Briggs\nstayed her rest-cure might be regarded as over.Then Kate Lumley occurred to her. She caught at Kate as at a straw.“It would have been delightful,” she said, faintly smiling at\nBriggs—she could not in decency not smile, at least a little, but even\na little betrayed the dimple, and Briggs’s eyes became more fixed than\never—“I’m only wondering if there is room.”“Yes, there is,” said Lotty. “There’s Kate Lumley’s room.”“I thought,” said Scrap to Mrs. Fisher, and it seemed to Briggs that he\nhad never heard music till now, “your friend was expected immediately.”“Oh, no,” said Mrs. Fisher—with an odd placidness, Scrap thought."

  "content": "“Miss Lumley,” said Mr. Wilkins, “—or should I,” he inquired of Mrs.\nFisher, “say Mrs.?”“Nobody has ever married Kate,” said Mrs. Fisher complacently.“Quite so. Miss Lumley does not arrive to-day in any case, Lady\nCaroline, and Mr. Briggs has—unfortunately, if I may say so—to continue\nhis journey to-morrow, so that his staying would in no way interfere\nwith Miss Lumley’s possible movements.”“Then of course I join in the invitation,” said Scrap, with what was to\nBriggs the most divine cordiality.He stammered something, flushing scarlet, and Scrap thought, “Oh,” and\nturned her head away; but that merely made Briggs acquainted with her\nprofile, and if there existed anything more lovely than Scrap’s full\nface it was her profile.Well, it was only for this one afternoon and evening. He would leave,\nno doubt, the first thing in the morning. It took hours to get to Rome.\nAwful if he hung on till the night train. She had a feeling that the\nprincipal express to Rome passed through at night. Why hadn’t that\nwoman Kate Lumley arrived yet? She had forgotten all about her, but now\nshe remembered she was to have been invited a fortnight ago. What had\nbecome of her? This man, once let in, would come and see her in London,\nwould haunt the places she was likely to go to. He had the makings, her\nexperienced eye could see, of a passionately persistent grabber."

  "content": "“If,” thought Mr. Wilkins, observing Briggs’s face and sudden silence,\n“any understanding existed between this young fellow and Mrs.\nArbuthnot, there is now going to be trouble. Trouble of a different\nnature from the kind I feared, in which Arbuthnot would have played a\nleading part, in fact the part of petitioner, but trouble that may need\nhelp and advice none the less for its not being publicly scandalous.\nBriggs, impelled by his passions and her beauty, will aspire to the\ndaughter of the Droitwiches. She, naturally and properly, will repel\nhim. Mrs. Arbuthnot, left in the cold, will be upset and show it.\nArbuthnot on his arrival will find his wife in enigmatic tears.\nInquiring into their cause, he will be met with an icy reserve. More\ntrouble may then be expected, and in me they will seek and find their\nadviser. When Lotty said Mrs. Arbuthnot wanted her husband, she was\nwrong. What Mrs. Arbuthnot wants is Briggs, and it looks uncommonly as\nif she were not going to get him. Well, I’m their man.”“Where are your things, Mr. Briggs?” asked Mrs. Fisher, her voice round\nwith motherliness. “Oughtn’t they to be fetched?” For the sun was\nnearly in the sea now, and the sweet-smelling April dampness that\nfollowed immediately on its disappearance was beginning to steal into\nthe garden.Briggs started. “My things?” he repeated. “Oh yes—I must fetch them.\nThey’re in Mezzago. I’ll send Domenico. My fly is waiting in the\nvillage. He can go back in it. I’ll go and tell him.”He got up. To whom was he talking? To Mrs. Fisher, ostensibly, yet his\neyes were fixed on Scrap, who said nothing and looked at no one.Then, recollecting himself, he stammered, “I’m awfully sorry—I keep on\nforgetting—I’ll go down and fetch them myself.”“We can easily send Domenico,” said Rose; and at her gentle voice he\nturned his head.Why, there was his friend, the sweet-named lady—but how had she not in\nthis short interval changed! Was it the failing light making her so\ncolourless, so vague-featured, so dim, so much like a ghost? A nice\ngood ghost, of course, and still with a pretty name, but only a ghost.He turned from her to Scrap again, and forgot Rose Arbuthnot’s\nexistence. How was it possible for him to bother about anybody or\nanything else in this first moment of being face to face with his dream\ncome true?Briggs had not supposed or hoped that any one as beautiful as his dream\nof beauty existed. He had never till now met even an approximation.\nPretty women, charming women by the score he had met and properly\nappreciated, but never the real, the godlike thing itself. He used to\nthink, “If ever I saw a perfectly beautiful woman I should die”; and\nthough, having now met what to his ideas was a perfectly beautiful\nwoman, he did not die, he became very nearly as incapable of managing\nhis own affairs as if he had."

  "content": "The others were obliged to arrange everything for him. By questions\nthey extracted from him that his luggage was in the station cloakroom\nat Mezzago, and they sent for Domenico, and, urged and prompted by\neverybody except Scrap, who sat in silence and looked at no one, Briggs\nwas induced to give him the necessary instructions for going back in\nthe fly and bringing out his things.It was a sad sight to see the collapse of Briggs. Everybody noticed it,\neven Rose.“Upon my word,” thought Mrs. Fisher, “the way one pretty face can turn\na delightful man into an idiot is past all patience.”And feeling the air getting chilly, and the sight of the enthralled\nBriggs painful, she went in to order his room to be got ready,\nregretting now that she had pressed the poor boy to stay. She had\nforgotten Lady Caroline’s kill-joy face for the moment, and the more\ncompletely owing to the absence of any ill effects produced by it on\nMr. Wilkins. Poor boy. Such a charming boy too, left to himself. It was\ntrue she could not accuse Lady Caroline of not leaving him to himself,\nfor she was taking no notice of him at all, but that did not help.\nExactly like foolish moths did men, in other respects intelligent,\nflutter round the impassive lighted candle of a pretty face. She had\nseen them doing it. She had looked on only too often. Almost she laid a\nmotherly hand on Briggs’s fair head as she passed him. Poor boy.Then Scrap, having finished her cigarette, got up and went indoors too.\nShe saw no reason why she should sit there in order to gratify Mr.\nBriggs’s desire to stare. She would have liked to stay out longer, to\ngo to her corner behind the daphne bushes and look at the sunset sky\nand watch the lights coming out one by one in the village below and\nsmell the sweet moistness of the evening, but if she did Mr. Briggs\nwould certainly follow her.The old familiar tyranny had begun again. Her holiday of peace and\nliberation was interrupted—perhaps over, for who knew if he would go\naway, after all, to-morrow? He might leave the house, driven out of it\nby Kate Lumley, but there was nothing to prevent his taking rooms in\nthe village and coming up every day. This tyranny of one person over\nanother! And she was so miserably constructed that she wouldn’t even be\nable to frown him down without being misunderstood."

  "content": "Scrap, who loved this time of the evening in her corner, felt indignant\nwith Mr. Briggs who was doing her out of it, and she turned her back on\nthe garden and him and went towards the house without a look or a word.\nBut Briggs, when he realised her intention, leapt to his feet, snatched\nchairs which were not in her way out of it, kicked a footstool which\nwas not in her path on one side, hurried to the door, which stood wide\nopen, in order to hold it open, and followed her through it, walking by\nher side along the hall.What was to be done with Mr. Briggs? Well, it was his hall; she\ncouldn’t prevent his walking along it.“I hope,” he said, not able while walking to take his eyes off her, so\nthat he knocked against several things he would otherwise have\navoided—the corner of a bookcase, an ancient carved cupboard, the table\nwith the flowers on it, shaking the water over—“that you are quite\ncomfortable here? If you’re not I’ll—I’ll flay them alive.”His voice vibrated. What was to be done with Mr. Briggs? She could of\ncourse stay in her room the whole time, say she was ill, not appear at\ndinner; but again, the tyranny of this . . .“I’m very comfortable indeed,” said Scrap.“If I had dreamed you were coming—” he began.“It’s a wonderful old place,” said Scrap, doing her utmost to sound\ndetached and forbidding, but with little hope of success.The kitchen was on this floor, and passing its door, which was open a\ncrack, they were observed by the servants, whose thoughts, communicated\nto each other by looks, may be roughly reproduced by such rude symbols\nas Aha and Oho—symbols which represented and included their\nappreciation of the inevitable, their foreknowledge of the inevitable,\nand their complete understanding and approval.“Are you going upstairs?” asked Briggs, as she paused at the foot of\nthem.“Yes.”“Which room do you sit in? The drawing-room, or the small yellow room?”“In my own room.”So then he couldn’t go up with her; so then all he could do was to wait\ntill she came out again.He longed to ask her which was her own room—it thrilled him to hear her\ncall any room in his house her own room—that he might picture her in\nit. He longed to know if by any happy chance it was his room, for ever\nafter to be filled with her wonder; but he didn’t dare. He would find\nthat out later from some one else—Francesca, anybody.“Then I shan’t see you again till dinner?”“Dinner is at eight,” was Scrap’s evasive answer as she went upstairs.He watched her go."

  "content": "She passed the Madonna, the portrait of Rose Arbuthnot, and the\ndark-eyed figure he had thought so sweet seemed to turn pale, to\nshrivel into insignificance as she passed.She turned the bend of the stairs, and the setting sun, shining through\nthe west window a moment on her face, turned her to glory.She disappeared, and the sun went out too, and the stairs were dark and\nempty.He listened till her footsteps were silent, trying to tell from the\nsound of the shutting door which room she had gone into, then wandered\naimlessly away through the hall again, and found himself back in the\ntop garden.Scrap from her window saw him there. She saw Lotty and Rose sitting on\nthe end parapet, where she would have liked to have been, and she saw\nMr. Wilkins buttonholing Briggs and evidently telling him the story of\nthe oleander tree in the middle of the garden.Briggs was listening with a patience she thought rather nice, seeing\nthat it was his oleander and his own father’s story. She knew Mr.\nWilkins was telling him the story by his gestures. Domenico had told it\nher soon after her arrival, and he had also told Mrs. Fisher, who had\ntold Mr. Wilkins. Mrs. Fisher thought highly of this story, and often\nspoke of it. It was about a cherrywood walking-stick. Briggs’s father\nhad thrust this stick into the ground at that spot, and said to\nDomenico’s father, who was then the gardener, “Here we will have an\noleander.” And Briggs’s father left the stick in the ground as a\nreminder to Domenico’s father, and presently—how long afterwards nobody\nremembered—the stick began to sprout, and it was an oleander.There stood poor Mr. Briggs being told all about it, and listening to\nthe story he must have known from infancy with patience."

How\nunfortunate, how extremely unfortunate, the determination that seized\npeople to get hold of and engulf other people. If only they could be\ninduced to stand more on their own feet. Why couldn’t Mr. Briggs be\nmore like Lotty, who never wanted anything of anybody, but was complete\nin herself and respected other people’s completeness? One loved being\nwith Lotty. With her one was free, and yet befriended. Mr. Briggs\nlooked so really nice, too. She thought she might like him if only he\nwouldn’t so excessively like her.Scrap felt melancholy. Here she was shut up in her bedroom, which was\nstuffy from the afternoon sun that had been pouring into it, instead of\nout in the cool garden, and all because of Mr. Briggs.Intolerable tyranny, she thought, flaring up. She wouldn’t endure it;\nshe would go out all the same; she would run downstairs while Mr.\nWilkins—really that man was a treasure—held Mr. Briggs down telling him\nabout the oleander, and get out of the house by the front door, and\ntake cover in the shadows of the zigzag path. Nobody could see her\nthere; nobody would think of looking for her there.She snatched up a wrap, for she did not mean to come back for a long\nwhile, perhaps not even to dinner—it would be all Mr. Briggs’s fault if\nshe went dinnerless and hungry—and with another glance out of the\nwindow to see if she were still safe, she stole out and got away to the\nsheltering trees of the zigzag path, and there sat down on one of the\nseats placed at each bend to assist the upward journey of those who\nwere breathless.Ah, this was lovely, thought Scrap with a sigh of relief. How cool. How\ngood it smelt. She could see the quiet water of the little harbour\nthrough the pine trunks, and the lights coming out in the houses on the\nother side, and all round her the green dusk was splashed by the\nrose-pink of the gladioluses in the grass and the white of the crowding\ndaisies.Ah, this was lovely. So still. Nothing moving—not a leaf, not a stalk.\nThe only sound was a dog barking, far away somewhere up on the hills,\nor when the door of the little restaurant in the piazza below was\nopened and there was a burst of voices, silenced again immediately by\nthe swinging to of the door.She drew in a deep breath of pleasure. Ah, this was—Her deep breath was arrested in the middle. What was that?She leaned forward listening, her body tense.Footsteps. On the zigzag path. Briggs. Finding her out.Should she run?"

  "content": "No—the footsteps were coming up, not down. Some one from the village.\nPerhaps Angelo, with provisions.She relaxed again. But the steps were not the steps of Angelo, that\nswift and springy youth; they were slow and considered, and they kept\non pausing.“Some one who isn’t used to hills,” thought Scrap.The idea of going back to the house did not occur to her. She was\nafraid of nothing in life except love. Brigands or murderers as such\nheld no terrors for the daughter of the Droitwiches; she only would\nhave been afraid of them if they left off being brigands and murderers\nand began instead to try and make love.The next moment the footsteps turned the corner of her bit of path, and\nstood still.“Getting his wind,” thought Scrap, not looking round.Then as he—from the sounds of the steps she took them to belong to a\nman—did not move, she turned her head, and beheld with astonishment a\nperson she had seen a good deal of lately in London, the well-known\nwriter of amusing memoirs, Mr. Ferdinand Arundel.She stared. Nothing in the way of being followed surprised her any\nmore, but that he should have discovered where she was surprised her.\nHer mother had promised faithfully to tell no one.“You?” she said, feeling betrayed. “Here?”He came up to her and took off his hat. His forehead beneath the hat\nwas wet with the beads of unaccustomed climbing. He looked ashamed and\nentreating, like a guilty but devoted dog.“You must forgive me,” he said. “Lady Droitwich told me where you were,\nand as I happened to be passing through on my way to Rome I thought I\nwould get out at Mezzago and just look in and see how you were.”“But—didn’t my mother tell you I was doing a rest-cure?”“Yes. She did. And that’s why I haven’t intruded on you earlier in the\nday. I thought you would probably sleep all day, and wake up about now\nso as to be fed.”“But—”“I know. I’ve got nothing to say in excuse. I couldn’t help myself.”“This,” thought Scrap, “comes of mother insisting on having authors to\nlunch, and me being so much more amiable in appearance than I really\nam.”"

  "content": "She had been amiable to Ferdinand Arundel; she liked him—or rather she\ndid not dislike him. He seemed a jovial, simple man, and had the eyes\nof a nice dog. Also, though it was evident that he admired her, he had\nnot in London grabbed. There he had merely been a good-natured,\nharmless person of entertaining conversation, who helped to make\nluncheons agreeable. Now it appeared that he too was a grabber. Fancy\nfollowing her out there—daring to. Nobody else had. Perhaps her mother\nhad given him the address because she considered him so absolutely\nharmless, and thought he might be useful and see her home.Well, whatever he was he couldn’t possibly give her the trouble an\nactive young man like Mr. Briggs might give her. Mr. Briggs,\ninfatuated, would be reckless, she felt, would stick at nothing, would\nlose his head publicly. She could imagine Mr. Briggs doing things with\nrope-ladders, and singing all night under her window—being really\ndifficult and uncomfortable. Mr. Arundel hadn’t the figure for any kind\nof recklessness. He had lived too long and too well. She was sure he\ncouldn’t sing, and wouldn’t want to. He must be at least forty. How\nmany good dinners could not a man have eaten by the time he was forty?\nAnd if during that time instead of taking exercise he had sat writing\nbooks, he would quite naturally acquire the figure Mr. Arundel had in\nfact acquired—the figure rather for conversation than adventure.Scrap, who had become melancholy at the sight of Briggs, became\nphilosophical at the sight of Arundel. Here he was. She couldn’t send\nhim away till after dinner. He must be nourished.This being so, she had better make the best of it, and do that with a\ngood grace which anyhow wasn’t to be avoided. Besides, he would be a\ntemporary shelter from Mr. Briggs. She was at least acquainted with\nFerdinand Arundel, and could hear news from him of her mother and her\nfriends, and such talk would put up a defensive barrier at dinner\nbetween herself and the approaches of the other one. And it was only\nfor one dinner, and he couldn’t eat _her_.She therefore prepared herself for friendliness. “I’m to be fed,” she\nsaid, ignoring his last remark, “at eight, and you must come up and be\nfed too. Sit down and get cool and tell me how everybody is.”“May I really dine with you? In these travelling things?” he said,\nwiping his forehead before sitting down beside her.She was too lovely to be true, he thought. Just to look at her for an\nhour, just to hear her voice, was enough reward for his journey and his\nfears."

But tell me,” he\nsaid, gazing at the adorable profile, “about yourself. London has been\nextraordinarily dull and empty. Lady Droitwich said you were with\npeople here she didn’t know. I hope they’ve been kind to you? You\nlook—well, as if your cure had done everything a cure should.”“They’ve been very kind,” said Scrap. “I got them out of an\nadvertisement.”“An advertisement?”“It’s a good way, I find, to get friends. I’m fonder of one of these\nthan I’ve been of anybody in years.”“Really? Who is it?”“You shall guess which of them it is when you see them. Tell me about\nmother. When did you see her last? We arranged not to write to each\nother unless there was something special. I wanted to have a month that\nwas perfectly blank.”“And now I’ve come and interrupted. I can’t tell you how ashamed I\nam—both of having done it and of not having been able to help it.”“Oh, but,” said Scrap quickly, for he could not have come on a better\nday, when up there waiting and watching for her was, she knew, the\nenamoured Briggs, “I’m really very glad indeed to see you. Tell me\nabout mother.”Chapter 20"

  "content": "Scrap wanted to know so much about her mother that Arundel had\npresently to invent. He would talk about anything she wished if only he\nmight be with her for a while and see her and hear her, but he knew\nvery little of the Droitwiches and their friends really—beyond meeting\nthem at those bigger functions where literature is also represented,\nand amusing them at luncheons and dinners, he knew very little of them\nreally. To them he had always remained Mr. Arundel; no one called him\nFerdinand; and he only knew the gossip also available to the evening\npapers and the frequenters of clubs. But he was, however, good at\ninventing; and as soon as he had come to an end of first-hand\nknowledge, in order to answer her inquiries and keep her there to\nhimself he proceeded to invent. It was quite easy to fasten some of the\nentertaining things he was constantly thinking on to other people and\npretend they were theirs. Scrap, who had that affection for her parents\nwhich warms in absence, was athirst for news, and became more and more\ninterested by the news he gradually imparted.At first it was ordinary news. He had met her mother here, and seen her\nthere. She looked very well; she said so and so. But presently the\nthings Lady Droitwich had said took on an unusual quality: they became\namusing.“Mother said _that?_” Scrap interrupted, surprised.And presently Lady Droitwich began to do amusing things as well as say\nthem.“_Mother_ did that?” Scrap inquired, wide-eyed.Arundel warmed to his work. He fathered some of the most entertaining\nideas he had lately had on to Lady Droitwich, and also any charming\nfunny things that had been done—or might have been done, for he could\nimagine almost anything.Scrap’s eyes grew round with wonder and affectionate pride in her\nmother. Why, but how funny—fancy mother. What an old darling. Did she\nreally do that? How perfectly adorable of her. And did she really\nsay—but how wonderful of her to think of it. What sort of a face did\nLloyd George make?She laughed and laughed, and had a great longing to hug her mother, and\nthe time flew, and it grew quite dusk, and it grew nearly dark, and Mr.\nArundel still went on amusing her, and it was a quarter to eight before\nshe suddenly remembered dinner.“Oh, good heavens!” she exclaimed, jumping up.“Yes. It’s late,” said Arundel.“I’ll go on quickly and send the maid to you. I must run, or I’ll never\nbe ready in time—”And she was gone up the path with the swiftness of a young, slender\ndeer.Arundel followed. He did not wish to arrive too hot, so had to go\nslowly. Fortunately he was near the top, and Francesca came down the\npergola to pilot him indoors, and having shown him where he could wash\nshe put him in the empty drawing-room to cool himself by the crackling\nwood fire."

The\ndrawing-room door was open, and the house was quiet with the hush that\nprecedes dinner, when the inhabitants are all shut up in their rooms\ndressing. Briggs in his room was throwing away spoilt tie after spoilt\ntie; Scrap in hers was hurrying into a black frock with a vague notion\nthat Mr. Briggs wouldn’t be able to see her so clearly in black; Mrs.\nFisher was fastening the lace shawl, which nightly transformed her day\ndress into her evening dress, with the brooch Ruskin had given her on\nher marriage, formed of two pearl lilies tied together by a blue enamel\nribbon on which was written in gold letters _Esto perpetua;_ Mr.\nWilkins was sitting on the edge of his bed brushing his wife’s\nhair—thus far in this third week had he progressed in\ndemonstrativeness—while she, for her part, sitting on a chair in front\nof him, put his studs in a clean shirt; and Rose, ready dressed, sat at\nher window considering her day.Rose was quite aware of what had happened to Mr. Briggs. If she had had\nany difficulty about it, Lotty would have removed it by the frank\ncomments she made while she and Rose sat together after tea on the\nwall. Lotty was delighted at more love being introduced into San\nSalvatore, even if it were only one-sided, and said that when once\nRose’s husband was there she didn’t suppose, now that Mrs. Fisher too\nhad at last come unglued—Rose protested at the expression, and Lotty\nretorted that it was in Keats—there would be another place in the world\nmore swarming with happiness than San Salvatore.“Your husband,” said Lotty, swinging her feet, “might be here quite\nsoon, perhaps to-morrow evening if he starts at once, and there’ll be a\nglorious final few days before we all go home refreshed for life. I\ndon’t believe any of us will ever be the same again—and I wouldn’t be a\nbit surprised if Caroline doesn’t end by getting fond of the young man\nBriggs. It’s in the air. You _have_ to get fond of people here.”Rose sat at her window thinking of these things. Lotty’s optimism . . .\nyet it had been justified by Mr. Wilkins; and look, too, at Mrs.\nFisher. If only it would come true as well about Frederick! For Rose,\nwho between lunch and tea had left off thinking about Frederick, was\nnow, between tea and dinner, thinking of him harder than ever."
