I need your help with analyzing emotions in a text. Could you please find passages in the text I'll provide below that relate to the following emotions:
Trust
Surprise
Anger
Joy
Anticipation
Fear
Disgust
Sadness
Acceptance
Admiration
Amazement
Distraction
Terror
Apprehension
Boredom
Loathing
Interest
Vigilance
Annoyance
Rage
Serenity
Ecstasy
Grief
Pensiveness
Contempt
Aggressiveness
Optimism
Love
Submission
Awe
Disapproval
Remorse
?

For each passage, I'd like you to note:

The name of the character experiencing the emotion.
The intensity of the felt emotion on a scale from 0 to 1.
The cause of the emotion.
The object associated with the emotion.
The exact place where the emotion is felt.
Here's the format I'd like your response to follow (in JSON format):
